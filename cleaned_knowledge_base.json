The income / gains generated from this collective investment scheme are distributed proportionately amongst the investors, after deducting applicable expenses and levies, by calculating a scheme's \"Net Asset Value\" or NAV. In return, mutual fund charges a small fee.\nIn short, mutual fund is a collective pool of money contributed by several investors and managed by a professional Fund Manager.\nMutual Funds in India are established in the form of a Trust under Indian Trust Act, 1882, in accordance with SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996.\nThe fees and expenses charged by the mutual funds to manage a scheme are regulated and are subject to the limits specified by SEBI.\nHOW A MUTUAL FUND WORKS?\nOne should avoid the temptation to review the fund's performance each time the market falls or jumps up significantly. For an actively-managed equity scheme, one must have patience and allow reasonable time - between 18 and 24 months - for the fund to generate returns in the portfolio.\nWhen you invest in a mutual fund, you are pooling your money with many other investors. Mutual fund issues \"Units\" against the amount invested at the prevailing NAV. Returns from a mutual fund may include income distributions to investors out of dividends, interest, capital gains or other income earned by the mutual fund. You can also have capital gains (or losses) if you sell the mutual fund units for more (or less) than the amount you invested.\nMutual funds are ideal for investors who –\nlack the knowledge or skill / experience of investing in stock markets directly.\nwant to grow their wealth, but do not have the inclination or time to re the stock market.\nwish to invest only small amount.\nWHY INVEST IN MUTUAL FUNDS?\nAs investment goals vary from person to person – post-retirement expenses, money for children's education or marriage, house purchase, etc. – the investment products required to achieve these goals too vary. Mutual funds provide certain distinct advantages over investing in individual securities. Mutual funds offer multiple choices for investment across equity shares, corporate bonds, government securities, and money market instruments, providing an excellent avenue for retail investors to participate and benefit from the uptrends in capital markets. The main advantages are that you can invest in a variety of securities for a relatively low cost and leave the investment decisions to a professional manager.\nHide\nWhat's Covered?\nWHAT ARE MUTUAL FUNDS ?\nHOW A MUTUAL FUND WORKS?\nWHY INVEST IN MUTUAL FUNDS?\nRelated Topics\nHistory of Mutual Funds in India\nMyths & Facts About Mutual Funds\nTypes of MF Schemes\nAssociation of Mutual Funds in India\nKnow About AMFI\nAbout AMFI\nObjectives\nBoard of Directors\nAMFI Executives\nCommittees\nView More\nMedia\nPress Release\nAMFI Publications\nAMFI Mutual Fund Summit\nGallery\nVideos\nOther Links\nSchedule of Investor Awareness Program\nAMC Branches\nLocate a MF Distributor\nUseful Links\nView More\nQuick Access\nLatest NAV\nDownload NAV\nDisclosure of Risk Parameters\nNew Fund Offer",

The daily NAV of a mutual fund is disclosed after deducting the expenses.\nCurrently, in India, the expense ratio is fungible, i.e., there is no limit on any particular type of allowed expense as long as the total expense ratio is within the prescribed limit. The regulatory limits of TER that can be incurred/charged to the fund by a Mutual Fund AMC have been specified under Regulation 52 of SEBI Mutual Fund Regulations.\nEffective from April 1, 2020 the TER limit has been revised as follows.\nIn addition, mutual funds have been allowed to charge up to 30 bps more, if the new inflows from retail investors from beyond top 30 cities (B30) cities are at least (a) 30% of gross new inflows in the scheme or (b) 15% of the average assets under management (year to date) of the scheme, whichever is higher. This is essentially to encourage inflows into mutual funds from tier - 2 and tier - 3 cities.\nTER has a direct bearing on a scheme’s NAV – the lower the expense ratio of a scheme, the higher the NAV\n. Thus, TER is an important parameter while selecting a mutual fund scheme.\nAs per the current SEBI Regulations, mutual funds are required to disclose the TER of all schemes on a daily basis on their websites as well as AMFI’s website.\nHide\nRelated Topics\nNet Asset Value\nTrack your MF Investments using Fund Fact Sheet\nDownload Various Forms\nAssociation of Mutual Funds in India\nKnow About AMFI\nAbout AMFI\nObjectives\nBoard of Directors\nAMFI Executives\nCommittees\nView More\nMedia\nPress Release\nAMFI Publications\nAMFI Mutual Fund Summit\nGallery\nVideos\nOther Links\nSchedule of Investor Awareness Program\nAMC Branches\nLocate a MF Distributor\nUseful Links\nView More\nQuick Access\nLatest NAV\nDownload NAV\nDisclosure of Risk Parameters\nNew Fund Offer",

It does this by putting a risk score on every asset class held by the mutual fund scheme. Each debt or equity instrument and other assets, such as cash, gold, and other financial instruments found in mutual fund portfolios, is assigned a particular risk value.\nIn the case of equities, each position in the portfolio is assigned a risk score based on three main factors:\nMarket Capitalization:\nSmall-cap stocks pose more risk than mid-cap stocks, which in turn are riskier than large-cap stocks. The risk value for each is updated every six months.\nVolatility:\nStocks with substantial daily price fluctuations are assigned a higher risk value. This is calculated from a stock's price behaviour over the past two years.\nImpact Cost (Liquidity)1:\nStocks with low trading volumes experience significant price shifts in large transactions. This raises the impact cost and corresponding risk value. This risk value is based on the three-month average impact cost, including the current month being evaluated.\nFor debt securities, risk assessment involves the following factors:\nCredit Risk2:\nThe risk value is lower for higher credit ratings (e.g., AAA/G-Sec/SDL/TREPS) and increases for securities with below-investment-grade ratings. This shift happens due to the rising likelihood of default in unrated and below-investment-grade securities.\nInterest-Rate Risk:\nThis risk is determined by using the Macaulay Duration of the portfolio. Bonds with longer maturity period have higher risk values due to their heightened sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates.\nLiquidity Risk3:\nLiquidity risk assessment considers factors like listing status, credit rating, and debt instrument structure.\nAdditionally,\nhas issued comprehensive guidelines for assigning risk values to other asset classes such as cash & net current assets, derivatives, gold, foreign securities, REITs & InvITs and more.\nThe total risk score is calculated by averaging each asset's risk value in a\nmutual fund portfolio\nLastly, this risk score is used to map the fund scheme to a certain risk level (i.e. Low, Moderately Low, Moderate, Moderately High, or High) on the riskometer .\nRisk Label\nFund’s Average Risk Score\nLow\nLow to Moderate\nModerate\nModerately High\nHigh\nVery High\n6 or more\nIt is important to note that the\nriskometer\nfor each mutual fund scheme is evaluated monthly. Mutual Funds/AMCs will display the updated riskometer and portfolio information on their website and the AMFI website within ten days of each month's conclusion.\n1. Impact Cost relies on how much the stock price changes when a large purchase or sale occurs.\n2. Credit risk indicates the likelihood of a borrower defaulting.\n3. Liquidity risk is a bond's ability to be sold before maturity due to market demand.\nDisclaimer\nMutual Fund investments\nare subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.\nRead More\nI Am Ready to Invest\nRelated Articles\nMore details are loading\nLoad More\nMore details are loading\nLoad More",

All\nmutual fund scheme documents\nhave to display the riskometer upfront and clearly so that investors know the risk associated with that particular fund.\nThe riskometer classifies risk into six distinct levels. These include Low, Low to Moderate, Moderate, Moderately High, High and Very High. Refer to the provided illustration on the left side.\nLow Risk:\nThe funds that fall under this category have the least risk due to their underlying securities, making them suitable for individuals seeking capital protection to some extent.\nLow to Moderate Risk:\nThese are for investors willing to take a bit of risk to get some returns over a medium to long time. Most ultra-short duration funds fall under this category.\nModerate Risk:\nThis is ideal for investors who aim to expand their portfolio taking some risks. Most dynamic bond funds fall under this category.\nModerately High Risk:\nThese funds hold a somewhat higher level of risk and might suit investors with a slightly higher risk profile. These are for investors willing to accept some uncertainty and greater volatility in exchange for the prospect of achieving higher growth or profitability.\nHigh Risk:\nFunds in this category mainly invest in equities. They are ideal for those willing to take on high risk for prospective gains.\nVery High Risk:\nThey are extremely risky funds that invest in volatile stocks or overseas mutual fund units. They’re for investors who are likely to invest in high-risk, high-reward investment opportunities.\nDisclaimer\nMutual Fund investments\nare subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.\nRead More\nI Am Ready to Invest\nRelated Articles\nMore details are loading\nLoad More\nMore details are loading\nLoad More",

Growth, appreciation, dividend and income, if any, referred to in this Scheme/Plan Information\nDocument are subject to the tax laws and other fiscal enactments as they exist from time to time. The\nNAVs of the Scheme/Plan may be affected by changes in the general market conditions, factors and forces\naffecting capital market, in particular, level of interest rates, various markets related factors and trading\nvolumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures.\n• The Scheme/Plan is not guaranteeing or assuring any dividend. The Scheme/Plan is also not assuring that it\nwill make periodical dividend distributions, though it has every intention of doing so. All dividend\ndistributions are subject to the availability of distributable surplus of the Scheme/Plan.\nScheme/Plan Specific Risk Factors\nRisk associated with investment in Equities and Equity related instruments\nThe Scheme/Plan’s investment in Equity and Equity related instruments are exposed to following risks:\n• Price Risk : Stock prices may rise or decline based on a number of factors. These could be a combination\nof company-specific and system-specific factors. Their impact on different types of stocks may vary. Prices\nchange due to events that impact entire financial markets or industries (for example, changes in inflation,\nconsumer demand, supply situation and GDP growth). Company specific factors may include the likes of\nsuccess or failure of a new product, mergers, takeovers, earnings announcement and changes in\nmanagement, to name a few. Securities owned by the Scheme may offer opportunities for growth because\nof high potential earnings growth; they may also involve greater risks than securities that do not have the\nsame potential.\n• Stock Market Volatility : Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse\nissuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Different parts of the market can react\ndifferently to these developments. The stock-specific volatility may also change over a period of time as\nthe characteristic of the stock undergoes a change in terms of market cap category.\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\n• Liquidity Risk : Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of\nthe equity and equity related investments made by the Scheme/Plan which could cause the Scheme/Plan to\nmiss certain investment opportunities. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different\nsettlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to\ndelays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The inability of the Scheme/Plan to make intended\nsecurities purchases due to settlement problems could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment\nopportunities.\nSecurities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger\namount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on exchanges or offer other exit options\nto the investor, including a put option. Within the regulatory limits, the Scheme/Plan may choose to invest\nin unlisted securities that offer attractive yields. this may however increase the risk of the portfolio.\nInvestments in equity and equity related securities involve high degree of risks and investors should not\ninvest in the Scheme/Plan unless they have the capacity to take the risk of losing their investment.\n• Dependency Risk : The scheme may invest in stocks and mutual funds and exchange-traded funds linked\nto stocks. Equity confers a proportionate share of the ownership of a company. Its value will depend on the\nsuccess of the company’s business, income paid to stockholders by way of dividend, the value of the\ncompany’s assets, quality of its corporate governance practice, its attractiveness relative to peers and\ngeneral market conditions. The scheme may also invest in convertible securities and warrants. Convertible\nsecurities generally are fixed income securities or preference shares that may be converted into common\nstock after a prescribed period.\n• Temporary Investment Risk : If the fund manager is of the view that market or economic conditions may\nbecome unfavourable for investors in equities, he may invest a higher proportion of the fund’s assets in\nshort-term and medium-term fixed income instruments as well as near cash equivalents. This may be a\ndefensive and temporary strategy. The fund manager may also adopt such a strategy while zeroing in on\nappropriate investment opportunities or to maintain liquidity. At times, such investments may lead to lower\nreturns. In these circumstances, the Scheme may be unable to achieve its investment goal.\n• Non - Diversification Risk : The scheme may pursue only a limited degree of diversification. It may invest\na greater proportion of assets in the securities of one issuer (within the limit permitted by regulation) as\ncompared to a diversified fund. This could have implications for the performance of the scheme. The\nScheme may be more sensitive to economic, business, political or other changes and this may lead to\nsizeable fluctuation in the Net Asset Value of the Scheme.\n• Asset - Class Risk : Stocks have historically outpaced other asset classes such as gold, fixed deposits and\nbonds, to name a few, over the long term in India. Individual stocks prices may, however, tend to rise and\ndecline in a dramatic manner. Such price movement may be due to company-specific aspects or factors\nsuch as inflation, interest rates and growth rates that affect the securities market in entirety. A slowdown in\ngrowth or a partial or full-blown recession may have a negative impact on prices of most stocks owned by\nthe Scheme.\nRisks Associated With Investments in Debt Securities and Money Market Instruments\nThe investment in debt securities money market instruments are exposed to following risks :\n• Credit Risk : Bonds/Debentures as well as other money market instruments issued by the corporate run the\nrisk of down grading by the rating agencies and even default as the worst case. Securities issued by\nCentral/State governments have lesser to zero probability of credit/default risk in view of the sovereign\nstatus of the issuer. For example: One notch downgrade of a AAA rated issuer to AA+ will have an adverse\nimpact on the price of the security and vice-versa for an upgrade of a AA+ issuer.\n• Interest Rate Risk : Bonds/ Central Government securities which are fixed income securities, run price-\nrisk like any other fixed income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nsecurities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The level of interest rates is determined by\nthe rates at which government raises new money through RBI and the price levels at which the market is\nalready dealing in existing securities, rate of inflation etc. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a\nfunction of the prevailing coupon rate, number of days to maturity of a security and the increase or\ndecrease in the level of interest rates. The prices of Bonds/Central Government securities are also\ninfluenced by the liquidity in the financial system and/or the open market operations (OMO) by RBI.\nPressure on exchange rate of the Rupee may also affect security prices. Such rise and fall in price of\nbonds/central government securities in the portfolio of the schemes may influence the NAVs of the\nschemes as and when such changes occur. For a fixed term scheme, where the maturity of the debt\nsecurities in the portfolio are in line with the maturity period of the respective schemes, the interest rate risk\nmay not be there, if the investment is held upto maturity.\n• Price Risk : As long as the scheme will be invested, their Net Asset Value (NAV) is exposed to market\nfluctuations, and their value can go up as well as down. The portfolio of fixed-income securities that the\nScheme invest in would be exposed to price changes on a day-to-day basis. These price changes may occur\ndue to instrument-specific factors as well as general macroeconomic conditions. In general, price of fixed-\nincome securities go up when interest rates fall, and vice versa.\n• Liquidity or Marketability Risk : The Indian debt market is such that a large percentage of the total\ntraded volumes on particular days might be concentrated in a few securities. Traded volumes for particular\nsecurities differ significantly on a daily basis. Consequently, the schemes might have to incur a significant\n“impact cost” while transacting large volumes in a particular security. A lower level of liquidity affecting\nan individual security (ies) or an entire market may have an adverse bearing on the value of the Scheme’s\nasset. This may more importantly affect its ability to sell particular securities with minimal impact cost as\nand when necessary to meet requirement of liquidity or to sell stocks in response to triggers such as a\nspecific economic/corporate event. Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may\nrestrict the liquidity of a few of the investments.\n• Risks related to duration : Fixed Income securities of any issuer that has higher duration could be more\nrisky in terms of price movements relative to those with lower duration. Thus any impact of interest rate\nchanges would be higher on securities with higher duration irrespective of the status of the issuer of the\nsecurity.\n• Non - diversification Risk : The scheme may pursue a reasonable degree of diversification adhering to the\nSEBI guidelines on limits for investments in a single sector, limits on investments in securities issued by a\nsingle issuer etc. It may invest a greater proportion of assets in the securities of one issuer / single sector\n(within the limit permitted by regulation) as compared to a diversified fund. This could have implications\nfor the performance of the Scheme. The Scheme may be more sensitive to economic, business, political or\nother changes and this may lead to sizeable fluctuation in the Net Asset Value of the Scheme.\n• Re-investment Risk : The investments made by the Scheme/Plans is subject to reinvestment risk. This risk\nrefers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the securities in the Scheme/Plans are\nreinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the “interest on interest” component. The risk is\nthat the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed.\n• Risk from zero coupon securities: The Scheme/Plan may invest in high yield Zero coupon securities for\nmaximisation of returns. The risk of the Scheme/Plan portfolio may increase to the extent of the exposure\nin Zero coupon securities. As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder\nof the security, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, the interest rate\nrisk of zero coupon securities is higher.\nRisk associated with Investments in Repo of Corporate Debt Securities\nIn repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with the seller\nagreeing to buy them back at later date. The difference between the repurchase price and the original sale\nprice represents the interest earned. A repo is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nreceiving corporate debt securities as collateral to protect against default. The Scheme/Plan will be exposed\nto following risk in case, if the Scheme/Plan proposes to invest in repo of corporate debt securities:\n• Counterparty Risk: This refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to buy back securities at\nthe contracted price. The Scheme/Plan will endeavor to manage counterparty risk by dealing only with\ncounterparties having strong credit profiles assessed through in-house credit analysis or with entities\nregulated by SEBI/RBI/IRDA\nCollateral Risk: In the event of default by the repo counterparty, the Scheme/Plans have recourse to the\ncorporate debt securities. Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to meet\nthe repo obligations. This risk is mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in AA and\nabove rated money market and corporate debt securities. In addition, appropriate haircuts are applied on the\nmarket value of the underlying securities to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying\ninstrument.\nRisk associated with Investments in Debt & Equity Derivatives\n• Valuation Risk : The risk in valuing the Debt & Equity derivative products due to inadequate trading data\nwith good volumes. Derivatives with longer duration would have higher risk viz a viz the shorter duration\nderivatives.\n• Mark to Market Risk : The day-to-day potential for an investor to experience losses from fluctuations in\nunderlying stock prices and derivatives prices.\n• Systematic Risk : The risk inherent in the capital market due to macro economic factors like Inflation,\nGDP, Global events.\n• Liquidity Risk : The risk stemming from the lack of availability of derivatives products across different\nmaturities and with different risk appetite.\n• Implied Volatility : The estimated volatility of an underlying security’s price and derivatives price.\n• Interest Rate Risk : The risk stemming from the movement of Interest rates in adverse direction. As with\nall the debt securities, changes in the interest rates will affect the valuation of the portfolios.\n• Credit Risk : The risk that the counterparty will default on its obligations in a derivative transaction is\nrelatively low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts. This risk is substantially mitigated where\nderivative transactions happen through clearing corporation.\n• System Risk : The risk arising due to failure of operational processes followed by the exchanges and OTC\nparticipants for the derivatives trading.\nRisk attached with the use of Derivatives\n• Interest Rate Swaps (IRSs) and Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) do also have inherent credit and\nsettlement risks. However, these risks are substantially less, as they are limited to the interest stream and\nnot the notional principal amount.\n• In an attempt to maximize returns and protect the value of portfolio and of the investors the Scheme/Plan\nmay have an exposure into derivative products. As and when the Scheme/Plan trades in the derivatives\nmarket there are risk factors and issues concerning the use of derivatives that investors should understand.\nDerivative products are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis\ndifferent from those associated with stocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding\nnot only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Derivatives require the maintenance of\nadequate controls to monitor the transactions entered into, the ability to assess the risk that a derivative\nadds to the portfolio and the ability to forecast price or interest rate movements correctly. There is a\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\npossibility that a loss may be sustained by the portfolio as a result of the failure of another party (usually\nreferred to as the “counterparty”) to comply with the terms of the derivatives contract. Other risks in using\nderivatives include the risk of mispricing or improper valuation of derivatives and the inability of\nderivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices.\n• Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as\ndisproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund\nmanager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the\nfund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No\nassurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies.\n• The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks\nassociated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.\nRisk Analysis on underlying asset classes in Securitisation\nSecuritisation – Features & Investment Strategy\nAsset securitisation is a process whereby commercial or consumer credits are packaged and sold in the\nform of financial instruments. A typical process of asset securitisation involves sale of specific Receivables\nto a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) set up in the form of a trust or a company. The SPV in turn issues\nfinancial instruments (e.g., promissory notes, pass through certificates or other debt instruments) to\ninvestors, such instruments evidencing the beneficial ownership of the investors in the Receivables. The\nfinancial instruments are rated by an independent credit rating agency. An Investor’s Agent is normally\nappointed for providing trusteeship services for the transaction.\nThe Scheme/Plan shall predominantly invest only in those securitisation issuances, which have AAA rating\nindicating the highest level of safety from credit risk point of view at the time of making an investment.\nGenerally available Asset Classes for securitisation in India are:\n(i) Commercial Vehicles\n(ii) Auto and Two wheeler pools\n(iii) Mortgage pools (residential housing loans)\n(iv) Personal Loan, credit card and other retail loans\n(v) Corporate loans / receivables\nThe Scheme/Plan may invest in various type of securitisation issuances as given above, including but not\nlimited to Asset Backed Securitisation, Mortgage Backed Securitisation, Personal Loan Backed\nSecuritisation, Collateralized Loan Obligation/Collateralized Bond Obligation and so on.\nRisk associated with investments in Securitised Papers\nTypes of Securitised Debt vary and carry different levels and types of risks. Credit Risk on Securitised\nBonds depends upon the Originator and varies depending on whether they are issued with Recourse to\nOriginator or otherwise. A structure with Recourse will have a lower Credit Risk than a structure without\nRecourse. Underlying assets in Securitised Debt may assume different forms and the general types of\nreceivables include Auto Finance, Credit Cards, Home Loans or any such receipts, Credit risks relating to\nthese types of receivables depend upon various factors including macro economic factors of these\nindustries and economies. Specific factors like nature and adequacy of property mortgaged against these\nborrowings, nature of loan agreement / mortgage deed in case of Home Loan, adequacy of documentation\nin case of Auto Finance and Home Loans, capacity of borrower to meet its obligation on borrowings in\ncase of Credit Cards and intentions of the borrower influence the risks relating to the asset borrowings\nunderlying the securitised debt.\nHolders of the securitised assets may have low credit risk with diversified retail base on underlying assets\nespecially when securitised assets are created by high credit rated tranches, risk profiles of Planned\nAmortisation Class tranches (PAC), Principal Only Class Tranches (PO) and Interest Only class tranches\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\n(IO) will differ depending upon the interest rate movement and speed of prepayment. Various types of\nmajor risks pertaining to Securitised Paper are as below:\n• Liquidity & Price risk : Presently, secondary market for securitised papers is not very liquid. This could\nlimit the ability of the investor to resell them. Even if a secondary market develops and sales were to take\nplace, these secondary transactions may be at a discount to the initial issue price due to changes in the\ninterest rate structure.\n• Delinquency and Credit Risk : Securitised transactions are normally backed by pool of receivables and\ncredit enhancement as stipulated by the rating agency, which differ from issue to issue. The Credit\nEnhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates represent an\nundivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and there is no obligation of either the Issuer or\nthe Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial\nrecourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors’ Representative. Delinquencies and\ncredit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the\nInvestor Payouts may get affected if the amount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough\nto cover the shortfall. On persistent default of a Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess\nand sell the underlying Asset. However many factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such\nAsset or the length of time required to realize the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at\nwhich such Asset may be sold may be lower than the amount due from that Obligor.\n• Prepayment Risk : Asset securitisation is a process whereby commercial or consumer credits are\npackaged and sold in the form of financial instruments. Full prepayment of underlying loan contract may\nduring the tenure of the paper. In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor\nand reinvestment risk.\nRisks associated with Securities Lending\nAs with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the risk\nof failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the\nagreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary.\nSuch failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities,\nthe inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible\nloss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved\nintermediary.\nRisks associated with investing in Foreign Securities\nThe Fund may invest in overseas debt / equities / ADR’s / GDR’s with the approval of RBI/SEBI, subject\nto such guidelines as may be issued by RBI/SEBI. The net assets, distributions and income of the\nscheme/plan may be affected adversely by fluctuations in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to\nthe Indian Rupee to the extent of investments in these securities. Repatriation of such investment may also\nbe affected by changes in the regulatory and political environments. The scheme/plan’s NAV may also be\naffected by a fluctuation in the general and specific level of interest rates internationally, or the change in\nthe credit profiles of the issuers.\nThe Fund may, where necessary, appoint advisor(s) for providing advisory services for such Scheme/plan’s\ninvestments. The appointment of such advisor(s) shall be in accordance with the applicable requirements of\nSEBI. The fees and expenses would illustratively include, besides the investment management fees,\ncustody fees and costs, transaction costs and overseas regulatory costs, the fees of appointed advisor(s).\nThe fees related to these services would be borne by the AMC and would not be charged to the\nScheme/plan.\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nRisk factor associated with Overseas Investment:\nSubject to necessary approvals and within the investment objectives of the Scheme/plan, the Scheme/plan\nmay invest in overseas markets which carry a risk on account of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates,\nnature of securities market of the country concerned, repatriation of capital due to exchange controls and\npolitical circumstances.\n• To the extent that the assets of the scheme/plans will be invested in securities denominated in foreign\ncurrencies, the Indian rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely\naffected by changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian rupee (if Indian rupee\nappreciates against these foreign currencies). The repatriation of capital to India may also be hampered by\nchanges in regulations concerning exchange controls or political circumstances as well as the application to\nit of other restrictions on investment. The scheme/plan may have to pay applicable taxes on gains from\nsuch investment.\n• As regards foreign equity securities that are traded on exchanges that are not located in India basis of\nvaluation will depend on the time zone of the respective country. For exchanges located in countries, with\ntime zone earlier than India, the NAV will be calculated based on the closing price of the foreign equity\nsecurity and the prevailing exchange rate on that date. For exchanges located in countries, with time zone\nlater than India, the NAV will be calculated based on the closing price of the foreign equity security and the\nprevailing exchange rate of the previous date.\n• Subject to the Regulations, the investments may be in securities which are listed or unlisted, secured or\nunsecured, rated or unrated, and acquired through secondary market purchases, RBI auctions, open market\nsales conducted by RBI etc., Initial Public Offers (IPOs), other public offers, placements, rights, offers,\nnegotiated deals, etc\n• To avoid duplication of portfolios and to reduce expenses, the Scheme/Plan may invest in any other\nScheme/Plans of the Fund to the extent permitted by the Regulations. In such an event, AMC will not\ncharge management fees on the amounts of the Scheme/Plans so invested, unless permitted by the\nRegulations.\n• Additional Risk Factors : The risk associated with underlying stocks remain the same except for the\nadditional risk of fluctuation in the exchange rate of the Indian Rupee vis-à- vis US Dollar – the currency in\nwhich GDRs / ADRs are denominated. To manage risks associated with the portfolio, foreign currency and\ninterest rate exposure, the Fund may use / invest in derivatives for efficient portfolio management including\nhedging and in accordance with the conditions as may be stipulated by SEBI / RBI. The Fund also hereby\navers that offshore investments shall be made subject to any / all approvals, as well as the conditions\nthereof as may be stipulated by SEBI / RBI and provided such investments do not result in expenses to the\nfund in excess of the ceiling, if any, on the expenses prescribed by SEBI. The expenses to the fund shall be\nlimited to the level which, in the opinion of the Fund, is reasonable and consistent with the costs and\nexpenses attendant to international investing. The Fund may, where necessary, appoint other intermediaries\nof repute such as advisors, sub-managers, sub-custodian etc. for managing and administering such\ninvestments. The appointment of such intermediaries shall be in accordance with the applicable\nrequirements of SEBI and within the permissible ceilings of expenses. The fees and expenses would\nillustratively include, besides the investment management fee, custody fees and costs, fees of appointed\noverseas advisors and sub-managers, transaction costs, and overseas regulatory costs.\n• The NAV of the Scheme/Plan to the extent invested in Debt and Money market securities are likely to be\naffected by changes in the prevailing rates of interest and are likely to affect the value of the Scheme/Plan’s\nholdings and thus the value of the Scheme/Plan’s Units.\n• The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated/ unrated\nsecurities offering higher yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio.\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\n• Securities which are not quoted on the stock exchanges are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger\namount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges or offer other exit\noptions to the investor, including a put option. The AMC may choose to invest in unlisted securities that\noffer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio.\n• While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these\ninvestments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges. Money market securities,\nwhile fairly liquid, lack a well-developed secondary market, which may restrict the selling ability of the\nScheme/Plan and may lead to the Scheme/Plan incurring losses till the security is finally sold.\n• Investment decisions made by the AMC may not always be profitable, even though it is intended to\ngenerate capital appreciation and maximize the returns by actively investing in equity and equity related\nsecurities.\nOther Scheme/Plan Specific Risk factors & Risk Mitigation Measures\n• The liquidity of the Scheme/Plan’s investments may be inherently restricted by trading volumes, settlement\nperiods and transfer procedures. In the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests, or of\na re-structuring of the Scheme/Plan’s investment portfolio, these periods may become significant. Please\nread the Sections of this Scheme/Plan Information Document entitled “Special Considerations” and\n“Right to Limit Redemptions” there under.\n• Although, the objective of the Fund is to generate optimal returns, the objective may or may not be\nachieved. The investors may note that if the AMC/Investment Manager is not able to make right decision\nregarding the timing of increasing exposure in debt securities in times of falling equity market, it may result\nin negative returns. Given the nature of Scheme/Plan, the portfolio turnover ratio may be on the higher side\ncommensurate with the investment decisions and Asset Allocation of the Scheme/Plan. At times, such\nchurning of portfolio may lead to losses due to subsequent negative or unfavorable market movements.\n• As redemption is allowed only after a Lock-in- Period of five years, the investor will not be able to take\nadvantage of the opportune moments, if any, during the Lock-in-Period.\n• Post necessary approval from CBDT, the tax benefits which shall be available under the Scheme/Plan will\nbe as per the present taxation laws and will be available only to certain specified categories of investors and\nthat is subject to fulfillment of the relevant conditions. The information given is included for general\npurposes only and is based on advise that the AMC has received regarding the law and the practice that is\ncurrently in force in India and the investors and the Unit Holders should be aware that the relevant fiscal\nrules and their interpretation may change. As is the case with any investment, there can be no guarantee\nthat the tax position or the proposed tax position prevailing at the time of investment in the Scheme/Plan\nwill endure indefinitely. In view of the individual nature of tax consequences, each Investor/Unit Holder is\nadvised to consult his/her own professional tax advisor.\nRisk Mitigation Measures:\nInterest Rate Risk / Reinvestment Risk: The Scheme would manage the interest rate risk & reinvestment\nrisk by adequately matching the duration of assets in line with the duration of the Scheme.\nCredit Risk: Scheme would predominantly invest in highly rated securities where there is an internal\ncredit comfort which would reduce the probability of credit risk.\nPortfolio Quality Risk: A pre approved universe of stocks / issuers based on fundamental re is\nmaintained to which helps to mitigate the risk of a poor portfolio quality.\nConcentration Risk: The Scheme would have modest presence of issuers with reasonable limits to\ndiversify the portfolio which would mitigate the credit concentration risk as well as sector /stock specific\nconcentration risk.\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nLiquidity Risk: Periodical review of the liquidity position of each scrip (Market capitalization, average\nvolume in the market vis. a vis. Portfolio Holding) to minimize liquidity risk.\nPortfolio Risk: By monitoring the return deviation and adequately managing all the above risks namely\ninterest rate risk, reinvestment risk & credit cum concentration risk the Scheme would mitigate the overall\nportfolio risk. Diversification of portfolio will also help to minimize interest rate risk, liquidity risk,\nportfolio quality risk and overall risks associated with the portfolio.\nInvestments in Equity and equity related instruments, carry various risks such as inability to sell securities,\ntrading volumes and settlement periods, market risk, liquidity risk, default risk, reinvestment risk etc.\nWhilst such risks cannot be eliminated, they may be mitigated by diversification and investing in well\nreed stocks/equity instruments. In order to mitigate the various risks, the portfolio of the Scheme will\nbe constructed in accordance with the investment restriction specified under the Regulations which would\nhelp in mitigating certain risks relating to investments in securities market. The diversification of the\nportfolio into instruments which are well reed by a robust re team under a strong internal\nprocess would be instrumental in mitigating the risks associated.\nFurther, the AMC has necessary framework in place for risk mitigation at an enterprise level. The Risk\nManagement division is an independent division within the organization. Internal limits are defined and\njudiciously monitored. Risk indicators on various parameters are computed and are monitored on a regular\nbasis. There is a Board level Committee, the Risk Management Committee of the Board, which enables a\ndedicated focus on risk factors and the relevant risk mitigates.\nB. REQUIREMENT OF MINIMUM INVESTORS IN THE SCHEME/PLAN\nThe Scheme/Plan shall have a minimum of 20 investors and no single investor shall account for more than\n25% of the corpus of the Scheme/Plan. The two conditions shall also be complied within each calendar\nquarter, on an average basis, as specified by SEBI. If there is a breach of the 25% limit by any investor over\nthe quarter, a rebalancing period of one month would be allowed and thereafter the investor who is in\nbreach of the rule shall be given 15 days notice to redeem his exposure over the 25% limit. Failure on the\npart of the said investor to redeem his exposure over the 25% limit within the aforesaid 15 days would lead\nto automatic redemption by the Mutual Fund on the applicable Net Asset Value on the 15th day of the\nnotice period. The Fund shall adhere to the requirements prescribed by SEBI from time to time in this\nregard.\nC. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n• Right to limit Purchase of units and/or Right to limit Redemption of units\nThe AMC may, in the general interest of the Unit holders of the Scheme under this Scheme Information\nDocument and keeping in view the unforeseen circumstances / unusual market conditions, limit the total\nnumber of Units which may be redeemed on any Business Day to 5% of the total number of Units then\nissued and outstanding under any Scheme / Plan or such other percentage as the AMC may determine.\nThe AMC may, at its sole discretion in response to unforeseen circumstances or unusual market conditions\nincluding, but not limited to, extreme volatility of the stock, fixed income and money markets, extended\nsuspension of trading on the stock exchanges, natural calamities, communication breakdowns, internal\nsystem breakdowns, strikes, bandhs, riots or other situations where the AMC, considers that such\nsuspension is necessary, limit the total number of Units which may be redeemed on any Business Day to\n5% of the total number of Units then in issue or such higher percentage as the AMC may determine in any\nparticular case.\nAny Units, which by virtue of these limitations are not redeemed on a particular Business Day, will be\ncarried forward for redemption to the next Business Day, in the order of receipt. Redemptions so carried\nforward will be priced on the basis of the Redemption Price of the Business Day on which redemption is\nmade. Under such circumstances, to the extent multiple redemption requests are received at the same time\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\non a single Business Day, redemption’s will be made on pro-rata basis, based on the size of each\nredemption request, the balance amount being carried forward for redemption to the next Business Day(s).\n• Suspension of Purchase and Redemption of Units\nThe purchase and/or redemption of Units may be suspended with prior approval of Trustees and Asset\nManagement Company giving the details of circumstances and justification for the proposed action shall\nalso be informed to SEBI in advance, temporarily or indefinitely when any of the following conditions\nexist at one/more Designated Investor Service Centre’s:\na) The stock market stops functioning or trading is restricted;\nb) Periods of extreme volatility in the stock market, fixed income or money market, which, in the opinion\nof the Investment Manager, are prejudicial or detrimental to the interest of the investors;\nc) Natural calamity;\nd) For any bulk processing like dividend, etc.\ne) If banks do not carry-out any of the normal Banking activities at one or more Designated Investor\nService Centers;\nf) In the event of breakdown in the means of communication used for the valuation of investments of the\nScheme, without which the value of the securities cannot be accurately calculated;\ng) In the event of any force majeure or disaster that affects the normal functioning of the AMC or the\ndesignated investor service centers;\nh) SEBI, by order, so directs;\ni) AMC also reserves the right at its sole discretion to withdraw sale of Units in the Scheme temporarily\nor indefinitely, if the AMC views that increasing the Scheme’s size further may prove detrimental to\nthe existing unit holders of the Scheme.

The underlying receivables generally comprise of loans of\nCommercial Vehicles, Auto and Two wheeler pools, Mortgage pools (residential housing loans), Personal\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nLoan, credit card and Corporate receivables. The instrument, which is issued, includes loans or receivables\nmaturing only after all receivables are realized. However depending on timing of underlying receivables,\nthe average tenure of the securitized paper gives a better indication of the maturity of the instrument.\n(iii) Regulators\nThe RBI operates both as the monetary authority and the debt manager to the government.

Further, the tenor of repo would\nbe taken based on nature and unit holders’ pattern of the Scheme/Plan.\n2) Counter-party risk\nCredit risk would arise if the counter-party fails to repurchase the security as contracted or if\ncounterparty fails to return the security or interest received on due date. To mitigate such risks, the\nScheme/Plans shall carry out repo transactions with only those counterparties, which has a credit\nrating of ‘A1+’ or ‘AA- and above’. In case of lending of funds as a repo buyer, minimum haircuts on\nthe value of the collateral security have been stipulated, and we would receive the collateral security in\nthe Scheme/Plan’s account before the money is lent to the counter-party. Overall, we would have a\nlimited number of counter-parties, primarily comprising of Mutual Funds, Scheduled Commercial\nbanks, Financial Institutions and Primary dealers.\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nSimilarly, in the event of the Scheme/Plan being unable to pay back the money to the counterparty as\ncontracted, the counter-party may hurriedly dispose of the assets (as they have sufficient margin) and\nthe net proceeds may be refunded to the Scheme/Plan. Thus, the Scheme/Plan may suffer losses in\nsuch cases. Sufficient funds flow management systems are in place to mitigate such risks.\n3) Collateral Risk (as a repo buyer)\nCollateral risks arise due to fall in the value of the security (change in credit rating and/or interest\nrates) against which the money has been lent under the repo arrangement. To mitigate such risks, we\nhave stipulated the minimum credit rating of the issuer of collateral security (‘AA’ for long-term\ninstruments / A1+ for money market instruments), maximum duration of the collateral security (10\nyears) and minimum haircuts on the value of the security. For further details refer to SAI/Addendum\nNo.7/2014-15 dated 7th July 2014.\n3. Participation in Derivative Products\nThe Scheme(s)/ Plan(s) may take derivatives position based on the opportunities available subject to\nthe guidelines provided by SEBI from time to time and in line with the overall investment objective of\nthe Scheme/Plan. The Scheme/Plan will comply with the prescribed disclosure requirements.\nDerivative Positions may be taken to hedge the portfolio, rebalance the same or to undertake any other\nstrategy as permitted under SEBI (MF) Regulations from time to time. Hedging does not mean\nmaximisation of returns but only reduction of systematic or market risk inherent in the investment.\nDerivatives:\nA derivative instrument, broadly, is a financial contract whose payoff structure is determined by the\nvalue of an underlying security, index, interest rate etc. Thus a derivative instrument derives its value\nfrom some underlying variable.\nDerivatives are further classified into\n• Futures\n• Options\n• Interest Rate Swaps\n• Forward Rate Agreements\nFutures:\nA futures contract is a standardized contract between two parties where one of the parties commits to\nsell, and the other to buy, a stipulated quantity of a security at an agreed price on or before a given date\nin future.\nOptions:\nAn option is a derivative instrument which gives its holder (buyer) the right but not the obligation to\nbuy or sell the underlying security at the contracted price on or before the specified date. The purchase\nof an option requires an up-front payment (premium) to the seller of the option.\nThere are two basic types of options, call option and put option.\n(a) Call option:\nA call option gives the buyer of the option the right but not the obligation to buy a given quantity of\nthe underlying asset, at a given price (strike price), on or before a given future date.\n(b) Put option:\nA put option gives the buyer of the option the right but not the obligation to sell a given quantity of\nthe underlying asset, at a given price (strike price), on or before a given future date.\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nOn expiry of a call option, if the market price of the underlying asset is lower than the strike price\nthe call would expire unexercised. Likewise, if, on the expiry of a put option, the market price of\nthe underlying asset is higher than that of the strike price the put option will expire unexercised.\nThe buyer/holder of an option can make loss of not more than the option premium paid to the\nseller/writer but the possible gain is unlimited. On the other hand, the option seller/writer’s\nmaximum gain is limited to the option premium charged by him from the buyer/ holder but can\nmake unlimited loss.\nInterest Rate Swaps:\nAll swaps are financial contracts, which involve exchange (swap) of a set of payments owned by one\nparty for another set of payments owned by another party, usually through an intermediary (market\nmaker). An IRS can be defined as a contract between two parties (Counter Parties) to exchange, on\nparticular dates in the future, one series of cash flows, (fixed interest) for another series of cashflows\n(variable or floating interest) in the same currency and on the same principal for an agreed period of\ntime. The exchange of cashflows need not occur on the same date. It may be noted that in such hedged\npositions (fixed v/s floating or vice versa), both legs of the transactions have interest rate volatility as\nunderlying. Debt derivatives are as of now customised over the counter products and there is no\nguarantee that these products will be available on tap. The provision for trading in derivatives is an\nenabling provision and it is not binding on the Scheme/Plan’s to undertake trading on a day to day\nbasis.\nForward Rate Agreement (FRA) :\nA FRA is an agreement between two counter parties to pay or to receive the difference between an\nagreed fixed rate (the FRA rate) and the interest rate prevailing on a stipulated future date, based on a\nnotional amount, for an agreed period. In short, in a FRA, interest rate is fixed now for a future period.\nThe special feature of FRAs is that the only payment is the difference between the FRA rate and the\nReference rate and hence are single settlement contracts. As in the case of IRS, notional amounts are\nnot exchanged.\nDerivatives can be traded over the exchange or can be structured between two counter-parties. Those\ntransacted over the exchange are called Exchange Traded derivatives whereas the other category is\nreferred to as OTC (Over the Counter) derivatives.\nSome of the differences of these two derivative categories are as under :\nExchange traded derivatives : These are quoted on the exchanges like any other traded asset class.\nThe most common amongst these are the Index Futures, Index Options, Stock Futures and Options on\nindividual equities / securities. The basic form of the futures contract is similar to that of the forward\ncontract, a futures contract obligates its owner to purchase a specified asset at a specified exercise\nprice on the contract maturity date. Futures are cash-settled and are traded only in organised\nexchanges. Exchange traded derivatives are standardised in terms of amount and delivery date.\nStandardisation and transparency generally ensures a liquid market together with narrower spreads. On\nthe other hand, for delivery dates far in the future, there may be insufficient liquidity in the futures\nmarket whereas an OTC price may be available.\nOTC derivatives : OTC derivatives require the two parties engaging in a derivatives transaction to\ncome together through a process of negotiation. It is a derivative that is customised in terms of\nstructure, amount, tenor, underlying assets, collateral etc. Some of the common examples are interest\nrate and currency swaps, Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) etc.\nPosition Limit in Derivatives\nThe position limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by SEBI vide SEBI Circular\nNo. DNPD/Cir-29/2005 dated September 14, 2005, SEBI Circular No. DNPD/Cir -30/2006 dated\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nJanuary 20, 2006 and SEBI Circular No. SEBI/DNPD/Cir-31/2006 dated September 22, 2006 are as\nfollows:\ni) Position limit for Mutual Funds in index options contracts\na.

This limit would be applicable on open positions in all options contracts on a particular underlying\nindex.\nii) Position limit for Mutual Funds in index futures contracts\na. The Mutual Fund position limit in all index futures contracts on a particular underlying index shall\nbe Rs. 500 crore or 15% of the total open interest of the market in index futures, whichever is\nhigher, per Stock Exchange.\nb. This limit would be applicable on open positions in all futures contracts on a particular underlying.\n(iii) Additional position limit for hedging\nIn addition to the position limits at point (i) and (ii) above, Mutual Funds may take exposure in\nequity index derivatives\nsubject to the following limits :\na. Short positions in index derivatives (short futures, short calls and long puts) shall not exceed (in\nnotional value) the Mutual Fund's holding of stocks.\nb. Long positions in index derivatives (long futures, long calls and short puts) shall not exceed (in\nnotional value) the Mutual Fund's holding of cash, government securities, T-Bills and similar\ninstruments.\n(iv) Position limit for Mutual Funds for stock based derivative contracts\nThe Mutual Fund position limit in a derivative contract on a particular underlying stock, i.e. stock\noption contracts and stock futures contracts will be as follows :-\na. For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit (MWPL) of Rs. 500 crores or more, the\ncombined futures and options position limit shall be 20% of applicable MWPL or Rs. 300 crores,\nwhichever is lower and within which stock futures position cannot exceed 10% of applicable\nMWPL or Rs. 150 crores, whichever is lower.\nb. For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit (MWPL) less than Rs. 500 crores, the\ncombined futures and options position limit would be 20% of applicable MWPL and futures\nposition cannot exceed 20% of applicable MWPL or Rs. 50 crore whichever is lower.\n(v) Position limit for each scheme of a Mutual Fund\nThe scheme-wise position limit requirements shall be :\na. For stock option and stock futures contracts, the gross open position across all derivative contracts\non a particular underlying stock of a scheme of a mutual fund shall not exceed the higher of:\n1% of the free float market capitalization (in terms of number of shares). or\n5% of the open interest in the derivative contracts on a particular underlying stock (in terms of\nnumber of contracts).\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nb. This position limits shall be applicable on the combined position in all derivative contracts on an\nunderlying stock at a Stock Exchange.\nc. For index based contracts, Mutual Funds shall disclose the total open interest held by its scheme or\nall schemes put together in a particular underlying index, if such open interest\nequals to or exceeds 15% of the open interest of all derivative contracts on that underlying index.\nSome of the derivative techniques/ strategies that may be used are:-\n(i) The Scheme/Plan will use hedging techniques including dealing in derivative products - like futures\nand options, warrants, interest rate swaps (IRS), forward rate agreement (FRA) as may be permissible\nunder SEBI (MFs) Regulations.\n(ii) The Scheme/Plan intends to use derivatives only for the purpose of hedging and/or re-balancing of the\nportfolio against any anticipated move in the equity and debt markets. A hedge is primarily designed\nto offset a loss on a portfolio with a gain in the hedge position.\n(iii) The Fund manager may use various strategies for trading in derivatives with a view to enhancing\nreturns and taking cover against possible fluctuations in the market. One of the strategies could be to\nuse index futures with a view to increasing/ decreasing the overall level of investment in equities.\n(iv) The Fund Manager may sell the index forward by taking a short position in index futures to save on\nthe cost of outflow of funds or in the event of negative view on the market.\n(v) The Schemes/Plans shall have a maximum derivatives net position of 25% of the portfolio, i.e. net\nassets, including cash. Within this, the restriction on asset allocation would apply to derivatives\nposition as well. This means that the maximum permissible derivatives position would be split in the\nsame ratio as the asset allocation specified in the Scheme/Plan Information Document.\nAs per the current norms of UTI AMC, the value of derivative contracts outstanding at any point of\ntime will be limited to 25% of the net assets of the Scheme/Plan at the time of investment. UTI AMC\nmay in future revise the limits within the SEBI (MFs) Regulations in keeping with the investment\nobjective of the Scheme/Plan. Such derivative position will comply with overall limits and norms of\nSEBI Circular No Cir / IMD / DF / 11 / 2010 dated August 18, 2010, DNPD/CIR-29/2005 dated\nSeptember 14, 2005, SEBI/DNPD/Cir-31/2006 dated September 22, 2006 and DNPD/CIR-31/2006\ndated January 20, 2006.\n4. Exposure limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds as per SEBI Circular No.\nCir/IMD/DF/11/2010 dated 18th August 2010:\na. The cumulative gross exposure through equity, debt and derivative positions should not exceed 100%\nof the net assets of the Scheme/Plan.\nb. Mutual Funds shall not write options or purchase instruments with embedded written options.\nc. The total exposure related to option premium paid must not exceed 20% of the net assets of the\nScheme/Plan.\nd. Cash or cash equivalents with residual maturity of less than 91 days may be treated as not creating any\nexposure.\ne. Exposure due to hedging positions may not be included in the above mentioned limits subject to the\nfollowing:-\n(i) Hedging positions are the derivative positions that reduce possible losses on an existing position in\nsecurities and till the existing position remains.\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\n(ii) Hedging positions cannot be taken for existing derivative positions. Exposure due to such\npositions shall have to be added and treated under limits mentioned in Point a.\n(iii) Any derivative instrument used to hedge has the same underlying security as the existing position\nbeing hedged.\n(iv) The quantity of underlying associated with the derivative position taken for hedging purposes does\nnot exceed the quantity of the existing position against which hedge has been taken.\nf. Mutual Funds may enter into plain vanilla interest rate swaps for hedging purposes. The counter party\nin such transactions has to be an entity recognized as a market maker by RBI. Further, the value of the\nnotional principal in such cases must not exceed the value of respective existing assets being hedged\nby the Scheme/Plan. Exposure to a single counterparty in such transactions should not exceed 10% of\nthe net assets of the Scheme/Plan.\ng. Exposure due to derivative positions taken for hedging purposes in excess of the underlying position\nagainst which the hedging position has been taken, shall be treated under the limits mentioned in point\nDefinition of Exposure in case of Derivative Positions\nEach position taken in derivatives shall have an associated exposure as defined under. Exposure is the\nmaximum possible loss that may occur on a position. However, certain derivative positions may\ntheoretically have unlimited possible loss. Exposure in derivative positions shall be computed as\nfollows:\nPosition Exposure\nLong Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts\nShort Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts\nOption bought Option Premium Paid * Lot Size * Number of Contracts.\nThe proceeds collected during the NFO shall be used only on or after the closure of the NFO\nperiod.\nThe AMC retains the right to enter into such derivative transactions as may be permitted by the\nRegulations from time to time.

Investment by these Schemes in any other Schemes of UTI AMC\nInvestment by these in other Mutual Fund schemes will be in accordance with Regulation 44(1),\nSeventh Schedule of the SEBI (MFs) Regulations as under: A scheme may invest in another scheme\nunder the same asset management company or any other mutual fund without charging any fees,\nprovided that aggregate inter scheme investment made by all schemes under the same management or\nin schemes under the management of any other asset management company shall not exceed 5% of the\nnet asset value of the mutual fund. Such investment will be consistent with the investment objective of\nthe schemes. No investment management fees will be charged by the AMC on such investment.\nE. WHAT ARE THE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES?\n1. UTI Retirement Benefit Pension Fund - Wealth Maximiser Scheme/Plan\nThe Wealth Maximiser Scheme/Plan, under normal market conditions, will invest in net assets primarily\nin Equity and equity related instruments and balance in fixed income securities, money market instruments\nand cash equivalents.\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nFor investments primarily in equity and equity related securities, the Wealth Creation Scheme would aim\nto provide long term capital growth by investing in a well diversified portfolio of equity and equity related\nsecurities.\nThe portfolio manager proposes to invest in equity and equity related instruments of companies with\ngreater emphasis on individual company metrics driven by in-depth re techniques and employing\nthe full potential of the re team at the AMC.\nThe overlying investment philosophy would be a combination of top down and bottom up approach\nwherein the objective is to identify and invest in companies that exhibit strong and sustainable growth and\nare valued at prices which are at a discount or in short do not reflect the growth potential.\n2. UTI Retirement Benefit Pension Fund - Income Generator Scheme/Plan\nThe Income Generator Scheme, under normal market conditions, will invest in net assets primarily in Debt\nand Money market instruments. The Scheme will retain the flexibility to invest across all the debt and\nmoney market instruments of various maturities. The AMC will strive to assess risk of the potential\ninvestment in terms of credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The AMC would manage the\ninvestments of the Scheme on a dynamic basis to exploit emerging opportunities in the investment\nuniverse and manage risks at all points in time. The AMC will also invest the net assets of the Scheme in\nEquity and Equity related instruments. This Scheme seeks to generate steady long term returns with\nrelatively low levels of risk.\nPortfolio Turnover Policy (for the above mentioned both the Schemes)\nPortfolio Turnover is defined as the least of purchase or sales as a percentage of average size of a fund\nduring any specified period of time. As sales and purchases of securities can be made on daily basis, it\nwould be difficult to estimate with reasonable level of accuracy the likely turnover in portfolios. There\ncould be instances of churning of portfolio to take advantage of trading opportunity existing in the market.\nBut it would be difficult to set the target for the portfolio turnover as it would be a function of purchases,\ngeneral market conditions, trading opportunities, creation of liquidity to meet income distribution etc. The\nportfolio turnover shall be targeted so as to have return maximization for the Unit Holders. At the same\ntime, expenses such as brokerage and transaction cost shall be kept at low level so that it does not affect\nthe earnings of the Scheme/Plan.\nF. FUNDAMENTAL ATTRIBUTES\nFollowing are the Fundamental Attributes of the Scheme/Plan, in terms of Regulation 18(15A) of the\nSEBI (MF) Regulations:\n(i) Type of Scheme/Plan\nUTI-Retirement Benefit Pension Fund – Wealth Maximiser Scheme/Plan and UTI-Retirement Benefit\nPension Fund – Income Generator Scheme/Plan are an open ended notified tax savings cum pension\nScheme/Plan with no assured returns.\n(ii) Investment objective\nMain Objective - as given in Clause II B\nInvestment pattern- The tentative Equity/Debt/Money Market portfolio break-up with minimum and\nmaximum asset allocation, while retaining the option to alter the asset allocation for a short term period on\ndefensive considerations – as given in Clause II C (1)\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\n(iii) Terms of issue\n• Liquidity provision of redemption: Only provisions relating to redemption as given in the SID.\n• Aggregate Expense and Fees [as given in clause IV (A) (2) to (3)] charged to the Scheme/Plan.\nIn accordance with Regulation 18(15A) of the SEBI (MF) Regulations, the Trustee shall ensure that no\nchange in the fundamental attributes of the Scheme/Plan(s) and the Plan(s) / Option(s) there under or the\ntrust or fees and expenses payable or any other change which would modify the Scheme/Plan(s) and\nPlan(s) / Option(s) there under and affect the interest of the Unit Holders, is carried out unless -\n(i) A written communication about the proposed change is sent to each unit holder and an advertisement\nis given in one English daily newspaper having nationwide circulation as well as in a newspaper\npublished in the language of the region where the Head Office of the Mutual Fund is situated; and\n(ii) The unit holders are given an option for a period of 30 days to exit at the prevailing Net Asset Value\nwithout any exit load.\nG. HOW WILL THE SCHEME/PLAN BENCHMARK ITS PERFORMANCE ?\nScheme/Plan Benchmark Index & Justification\nWealth Maximiser Scheme/Plan: S&P BSE 100 Index. Considering the\ninvestment in the fund made in equity /equity\nrelated securities with the objective of\nachieving long term wealth creation, we\npropose S&P BSE 100 Index as a benchmark\nsince majority of the stocks relate to the broader\ninvestment philosophy of the fund which is to\ninvest in stocks with potential for future growth\nand good track record.\nIncome Generator Scheme/Plan: CRISIL MIP Blended Index. Considering the\ninvestment of the fund predominantly in Debt\nand Money market securities and balance in\nequity and equity related instruments, we\npropose CRISIL MIP Blended Index as a\nbenchmark since it comprises of NIFTY and\nComposite Bond fund index, which covers\ninstruments across all maturities and credit\nrating in which Scheme/Plan is expected to\ninvest.\nThe Trustee reserves the right to change the benchmark for evaluation of performance of the Scheme from\ntime to time in conformity with the investment objectives and appropriateness of the benchmark subject to\nSEBI Regulations, and other prevailing guidelines, if any.\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nH.

Therefore MS Shoes called upon the underwriters\nto discharge their underwriting liability to the extent of proportionate devolution and raised a claim on\nthe bank for Rs.116,665,043 towards devolution of underwriting liability.\nThe bank declined the claim on the ground that since the issue was declared oversubscribed by the\nRegistrars to the issue no liability can devolve on the Bank under its underwriting commitment.\nSEBI has issued an enquiry notice dated July 20, 1995 to the bank, but closed the matter without\nimposing any penalty on the bank.\nComplaint was filed on behalf of MS Shoes, at Vikaspuri Police Station against SBI Capital Markets\nLimited, the bank, its principal officers including the then CMD and others alleging cheating and\nbreach of trust.

Settlement periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges. The inability of a mutual fund to sell securities held in the portfolio could result in potential losses to the scheme, should there be a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in the scheme portfolio and may thus lead to the fund incurring losses till the security is finally sold.\nEvent Risk:\nPrice risk due to company or sector specific event.\nRisks Associated with investment in Debt Securities and Money Market Instruments\nDebt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer’s inability to meet principal and interest payments on the obligation (Credit Risk) on the due date(s) and may also be subject to price volatility due to such factors as interest rate sensitivity, market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (Market Risk).\nThe timing of transactions in debt obligations, which will often depend on the timing of the Purchases and Redemptions in the Scheme, may result in capital appreciation or depreciation because the value of debt obligations generally varies inversely with the prevailing interest rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nMarket value of fixed income securities is generally inversely related to interest rate movement. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of existing fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase. Accordingly, value of a scheme portfolio may fall if the market interest rate rise and may appreciate when the market interest rate comes down. The extent of fall or rise in the prices depends upon the coupon and maturity of the security. It also depends upon the yield level at which the security is being traded.\nCredit Risk\nThis is risk associated with default on interest and /or principal amounts by issuers of fixed income securities. In case of a default, scheme may not fully receive the due amounts and NAV of the scheme may fall to the extent of default. Even when there is no default, the price of a security may change with expected changes in the credit rating of the issuer. It may be mentioned here that a government security is a sovereign security and is safer. Corporate bonds carry a higher amount of credit risk than government securities. Within corporate bonds also there are different levels of safety and a bond rated higher by a rating agency is safer than a bond rated lower by the same rating agency.\nSpread Risk\nCredit spreads on corporate bonds may change with varying market conditions. Market value of debt securities in portfolio may depreciate if the credit spreads widen and vice versa. Similarly, in case of floating rate securities, if the spreads over the benchmark security / index widen, then the value of such securities may depreciate.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk refers to the ease with which securities can be sold at or near its valuation yield-to-maturity (YTM) or true value. Liquidity condition in market varies from time to time. The liquidity of a bond may change, depending on market conditions leading to changes in the liquidity premium attached to the price of the bond. In an environment of tight liquidity, necessity to sell securities may have higher than usual impact cost. Further, liquidity of any particular security in portfolio may lessen depending on market condition, requiring higher discount at the time of selling.\nThe primary measure of liquidity risk is the spread between the bid price and the offer price quoted by a dealer. Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of some of these investments. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods, and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Further, delays in settlement could result in temporary periods when a portion of the assets of the Scheme are not invested and no return is earned thereon or the Scheme may miss attractive investment opportunities.\nAt the time of selling the security, the security may become illiquid, leading to loss in value of the portfolio. The purchase price and subsequent valuation of restricted and illiquid securities may reflect a discount, which may be significant, from the market price of comparable securities for which a liquid market exists.\nCounterparty Risk\nThis is the risk of failure of the counterparty to a transaction to deliver securities against consideration received or to pay consideration against securities delivered, in full or in part or as per the agreed specification. There could be losses to the fund in case of a counterparty default.\nPrepayment Risk\nThis arises when the borrower pays off the loan sooner than the due date. This may result in a change in the yield and tenor for the mutual fund scheme. When interest rates decline, borrowers tend to pay off high interest loans with money borrowed at a lower interest rate, which shortens the average maturity of Asset-backed securities (ABS). However, there is some prepayment risk even if interest rates rise, such as when an owner pays off a mortgage when the house is sold or an auto loan is paid off when the car is sold. Since prepayment risk increases when interest rates decline, this also introduces reinvestment risk, which is the risk that the principal may only be reinvested at a lower rate.\nRe-investment Risk\nInvestments in fixed income securities carry re-investment risk as the interest rates prevailing on the coupon payment or maturity dates may differ from the original coupon of the bond (the purchase yield of the security). This may result in final realized yield to be lower than that expected at the time\nThe additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on interest\" component. There may be a risk that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested are lower than that originally assumed.\nHide\nWhat's Covered?\nSTANDARD RISK FACTORS\nSPECIFIC RISK FACTORS\nRisks associated with investments in Equities\nRisks Associated with investment in Debt Securities and Money Market Instruments\nRelated Topics\nMyths & Facts About Mutual Funds\nAdvantages of Investing in MF\nHow to invest in Mutual Funds\nAssociation of Mutual Funds in India\nKnow About AMFI\nAbout AMFI\nObjectives\nBoard of Directors\nAMFI Executives\nCommittees\nView More\nMedia\nPress Release\nAMFI Publications\nAMFI Mutual Fund Summit\nGallery\nVideos\nOther Links\nSchedule of Investor Awareness Program\nAMC Branches\nLocate a MF Distributor\nUseful Links\nView More\nQuick Access\nLatest NAV\nDownload NAV\nDisclosure of Risk Parameters\nNew Fund Offer",

Equity funds may focus on certain sectors of the market or may have a specific investment style, such as investing in value or growth stocks.\nEquity Fund Categories as per SEBI guidelines on Categorization and Rationalization of schemes\nSector Specific Funds\nSectoral funds invest in a particular sector of the economy such as infrastructure, banking, technology or pharmaceuticals etc.\n– Since these funds focus on just one sector of the economy, they limit diversification, and are thus riskier.\n– Timing of investment into such funds are important, because the performance of the sectors tend to be cyclical.\nExamples of Sector Specific Funds - Equity Mutual Funds with an investment objective to invest in\nPharma & Healthcare Sector\nBanking & Finance Sector:\nFMCG (fast moving consumer goods) and related sectors.\nTechnology and related sectors\nThematic funds\nThematic funds select stocks of companies in industries that belong to a particular theme - For example, Infrastructure, Service industries, PSUs or MNCs.\nThey are more diversified than Sectoral Funds and hence have lower risk than Sectoral funds.\nValue Funds (Strategy and Style Based Funds)\nEquity funds may be categorized based on the valuation parameters adopted in stock selection, such as\n– Growth funds identify momentum stocks that are expected to perform better than the market\n– Value funds identify stocks that are currently undervalued but are expected to perform well over time as the value is unlocked\nEquity funds may hold a concentrated portfolio to benefit from stock selection.\n– These funds will have a higher risk since the effect of a wrong selection can be substantial on the portfolio’s return\nContra Funds\nContra funds are equity mutual funds that take a contrarian view on the market.\nUnderperforming stocks and sectors are picked at low price points with a view that they will perform in the long run.\nThe portfolios of contra funds have defensive and beaten down stocks that have given negative returns during bear markets.\nThese funds carry the risk of getting calls wrong as catching a trend before the herd is not possible in every market cycle and these funds typically underperform in a bull market.\nAs per the SEBI guidelines on Scheme categorisation of mutual funds, a fund house can either offer a Contra Fund or a Value Fund, not both.\nEquity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS)\nELSS invests at least 80% in stocks in accordance with Equity Linked Saving Scheme, 2005, notified by Ministry of Finance.\nHas lock-in period of 3 years (which is shortest amongst all other tax saving options)\nCurrently eligible for deduction under Sec 80C of the Income Tax Act upto ₹1,50,000\nA debt fund (also known as income fund) is a fund that invests primarily in bonds or other debt securities.\nDebt funds invest in short and long-term securities issued by government, public financial institutions, companies\n– Treasury bills, Government Securities, Debentures, Commercial paper, Certificates of Deposit and others\nDebt funds can be categorized based on the tenor of the securities held in the portfolio and/or on the basis of the issuers of the securities or their fund management strategies, such as\n– Short-term funds, Medium-term funds, Long-term funds\n– Gilt fund, Treasury fund, Corporate bond fund, Infrastructure debt fund\nFloating rate funds, Dynamic Bond funds, Fixed Maturity Plans\nDebt funds have potential for income generation and capital preservation.\nDebt Fund Categories as per SEBI guidelines on Categorization and Rationalization of schemes\nDynamic Bond funds alter the tenor of the securities in the portfolio in line with expectation on interest rates. The tenor is increased if interest rates are expected to go down and vice versa\nFloating rate funds invest in bonds whose interest are reset periodically so that the fund earns coupon income that is in line with current rates in the market, and eliminates interest rate risk to a large extent\nShort-Term Debt Funds\nThe primary focus of short-term debt funds is coupon income. Short term debt funds have to also be evaluated for the credit risk they may take to earn higher coupon income. The tenor of the securities will define the return and risk of the fund.\n– Funds holding securities with lower tenors have lower risk and lower return.\nLiquid funds invest in securities with not more than 91 days to maturity.\nUltra Short-Term Debt Funds hold a portfolio with a slightly higher tenor to earn higher coupon income.\nShort-Term Fund combine coupon income earned from a pre-dominantly short-term debt portfolio with some exposure to longer term securities to benefit from appreciation in price.\nFixed Maturity Plans (FMPs)\n-FMPs are closed-ended funds which eliminate interest rate risk and lock-in a yield by investing only in securities whose maturity matches the maturity of the fund.\n– FMPs create an investment portfolio whose maturity profile match that of the FMP tenor.\n– Potential to provide better returns than liquid funds and Ultra Short Term Funds since investments are locked in\n– Low mark to market risk as investments are liquidated at maturity.\n– Investors commit money for a fixed period.\n– Investors cannot prematurely redeem the units from the fund\n– FMPs, being closed-end schemes are mandatorily listed - investors can buy or sell units of FMPs only on the stock exchange after the NFO.\n– Only Units held in dematerialized mode can be traded; therefore investors seeking liquidity in such schemes need to have a demat accoun\nCapital Protection Oriented Funds\nCapital Protection Oriented Funds are close-ended hybrid funds that create a portfolio of debt instruments and equity derivatives\n– The portfolio is structured to provide capital protection and is rated by a credit rating agency on its ability to do so. The rating is reviewed every quarter.\n– The debt component of the portfolio has to be invested in instruments with the highest investment grade rating.\n– A portion of the amount brought in by the investors is invested in debt instruments that is expected to mature to the par value of the capital invested by investors into the fund. The capital is thus protected.\n– The remaining portion of the funds is used to invest in equity derivatives to generate higher returns\nHybrid funds\nHybrid funds Invest in a mix of equities and debt securities.\nSEBI has classified Hybrid funds into 7 sub-categories as follows:\nSolution-oriented & Other funds\nHybrid funds\nInvest in a mix of equities and debt securities. They seek to find a ‘balance’ between growth and income by investing in both equity and debt.\n– The regular income earned from the debt instruments provide greater stability to the returns from such funds.\n– The proportion of equity and debt that will be held in the portfolio is indicated in the Scheme Information Document\n– Equity oriented hybrid funds (Aggressive Hybrid Funds) are ideal for investors looking for growth in their investment with some stability.\n– Debt-oriented hybrid funds (Conservative Hybrid Fund) are suitable for conservative investors looking for a boost in returns with a small exposure to equity.\n– The risk and return of the fund will depend upon the equity exposure taken by the portfolio - Higher the allocation to equity, greater is the risk\nMulti Asset Funds\nA multi-asset fund offers exposure to a broad number of asset classes, often offering a level of diversification typically associated with institutional investing.\nMulti-asset funds may invest in a number of traditional equity and fixed income strategies, index-tracking funds, financial derivatives as well as commodity like gold.\nThis diversity allows portfolio managers to potentially balance risk with reward and deliver steady, long-term returns for investors, particularly in volatile markets.\nArbitrage Funds\n“Arbitrage” is the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset to take advantage of the price differential in the two markets and profit from price difference of the asset on different markets or in different forms.\n– Arbitrage fund buys a stock in the cash market and simultaneously sells it in the Futures market at a higher price to generate returns from the difference in the price of the security in the two markets.\n– The fund takes equal but opposite positions in both the markets, thereby locking in the difference.\n– The positions have to be held until expiry of the derivative cycle and both positions need to be closed at the same price to realize the difference.\n– The cash market price converges with the Futures market price at the end of the contract period. Thus it delivers risk-free profit for the investor/trader.\n– Price movements do not affect initial price differential because the profit in one market is set-off by the loss in the other market.\n– Since mutual funds invest own funds, the difference is fully the return.\nHence, Arbitrage funds are considered to be a good choice for cautious investors who want to benefit from a volatile market without taking on too much risk.\nIndex Funds\nIndex funds create a portfolio that mirrors a market index.\n– The securities included in the portfolio and their weights are the same as that in the index\n– The fund manager does not rebalance the portfolio based on their view of the market or sector\n– Index funds are passively managed, which means that the fund manager makes only minor, periodic adjustments to keep the fund in line with its index. Hence, Index fund offers the same return and risk represented by the index it tracks.\n– The fees that an index fund can charge is capped at 1.5%\nInvestors have the comfort of knowing the stocks that will form part of the portfolio, since the composition of the index is known.\nExchange Traded Funds (ETFs)\nAn ETF is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund.\nETFs are listed on stock exchanges.\nUnlike regular mutual funds, an ETF trades like a common stock on a stock exchange. The traded price of an ETF changes throughout the day like any other stock, as it is bought and sold on the stock exchange.\nETF Units are compulsorily held in Demat mode\nETFs are passively managed, which means that the fund manager makes only minor, periodic adjustments to keep the fund in line with its index\nBecause an ETF tracks an index without trying to outperform it, it incurs lower administrative costs than actively managed portfolios.\nRather than investing in an ‘active’ fund managed by a fund manager, when one buy units of an ETF one is harnessing the power of the market itself.\nSuitable for investors seeking returns similar to index and liquidity similar to stocks\nFund of Funds (FoF)\nFund of funds are mutual fund schemes that invest in the units of other schemes of the same mutual fund or other mutual funds.\nThe schemes selected for investment will be based on the investment objective of the FoF\nThe FoF have two levels of expenses: that of the scheme whose units the FoF invests in and the expense of the FoF itself. Regulations limit the total expenses that can be charged across both levels as follows:\n– TER in respect of FoF investing liquid schemes, index funds & ETFs has been capped @ 1%\n– TER of FoF investing in equity-oriented schemes has been capped @ 2.25%\n– TER of FoF investing in other schemes than mentioned above has been capped @2%.\nGold Exchange Traded Funds (FoF)\nGold ETFs are ETFs with gold as the underlying asset\n– The scheme will issue units against gold held. Each unit will represent a defined weight in gold, typically one gram.\n– The scheme will hold gold in form of physical gold or gold related instruments approved by SEBI.\n– Schemes can invest up to 20% of net assets in Gold Deposit Scheme of banks\nThe price of ETF units moves in line with the price of gold on metal exchange.\nAfter the NFO, units are issued to intermediaries called authorized participants against gold or funds submitted. They can also redeem the units for the underlying gol\nBenefits of Gold ETFs\nConvenience --> option of holding gold electronically instead of physical gold.\n– Safer option to hold gold since there are no risks of theft or purity.\n– Provides easy liquidity and ease of transaction.\nFor the purpose of capital gains taxation, Gold ETFs are considered as  \"Specified Mutual Funds\" (i.e., non-equity oriented mutual funds).\nNo wealth tax is applicable on Gold ETFs .\nInternational Funds\nInternational funds enable investments in markets outside India, by holding in their portfolio one or more of the following:\n– Equity of companies listed abroad.\n– ADRs and GDRs of Indian companies.\n– Debt of companies listed abroad.\n– ETFs of other countries.\n– Units of passive index funds in other countries.\n– Units of actively managed mutual funds in other countries.\nInternational equity funds may also hold some of their portfolios in Indian equity or debt.\n– They can hold some portion of the portfolio in money market instruments to manage liquidity.\nInternational funds gives the investor additional benefits of\n– Diversification, since global markets may have a low correlation with domestic markets.\n– Investment options that may not be available domestically.\n– Access to companies that are global leaders in their field.\nThere are risks associated with investing in such funds, such as –\n– Political events and macro economic factors that are less familiar and therefore difficult to interpret\n– Movements in foreign exchange rate may affect the return on redemption\n– Countries may change their investment policy towards global investors.\nFor the purpose of taxation, these funds are considered as non-equity oriented mutual fund schemes.\nHide\nWhat's Covered?\nSector Specific Funds\nThematic funds\nValue Funds (Strategy and Style Based Funds)\nContra Funds\nEquity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS)\nShort-Term Debt Funds\nFixed Maturity Plans (FMPs)\nCapital Protection Oriented Funds\nHybrid funds\nMulti Asset Funds\nArbitrage Funds\nIndex Funds\nExchange Traded Funds (ETFs)\nFund of Funds (FoF)\nGold Exchange Traded Funds (FoF)\nBenefits of Gold ETFs\nInternational Funds\nRelated Topics\nTypes of MF Schemes\nRisks in MF\nAdvantages of Investing in MF\nAssociation of Mutual Funds in India\nKnow About AMFI\nAbout AMFI\nObjectives\nBoard of Directors\nAMFI Executives\nCommittees\nView More\nMedia\nPress Release\nAMFI Publications\nAMFI Mutual Fund Summit\nGallery\nVideos\nOther Links\nSchedule of Investor Awareness Program\nAMC Branches\nLocate a MF Distributor\nUseful Links\nView More\nQuick Access\nLatest NAV\nDownload NAV\nDisclosure of Risk Parameters\nNew Fund Offer",

These funds primarily invest in equity and equity-related instruments, offering the potential for high returns along with the added advantage of tax deductions.\nELSS has gained popularity due to its dual advantage of tax efficiency and wealth creation over the long term. It is an ideal choice for those who are comfortable with market-linked investments and aim to build wealth while saving on taxes.\nMeaning of ELSS\nAn ELSS is a diversified equity mutual fund where at least 80% of the corpus is invested in equity and equity-related instruments. It has a lock-in period of three years, which is the shortest among all tax-saving investment options under Section 80C. The returns, though not guaranteed, are market-linked and have the potential to outperform traditional savings instruments in the long run.\nHow ELSS Works\nInvestment:\nInvestors can invest a lump sum or opt for a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) to contribute small amounts regularly.\nLock-in Period:\nOnce invested, the amount is locked in for three years. During this period, you cannot withdraw the funds.\nMarket Linkage:\nThe returns depend on the performance of the equity markets as the fund manager invests in a mix of stocks across various sectors of market.\nTax Deduction:\nUnder Section 80C, an investment of up to ₹1.5 lakh in ELSS qualifies for a tax deduction in a financial year.\nRedemption:\nAfter the lock-in period, the investor can redeem the units or continue holding them for further growth.\nBenefits of ELSS\nTax Savings :\nELSS is a preferred option for those looking to reduce their taxable income.\nWealth Creation :\nBy investing in equities, ELSS has the potential to generate inflation-beating returns.\nDiscipline :\nThe lock-in period ensures disciplined investing and prevents impulsive withdrawals.\nFlexibility :\nInvestors can opt for SIP or lump sum investments, depending on their financial goals and cash flow.\nProfessional Management :\nThe fund is managed by experienced professionals, ensuring informed investment decisions\nKey Features of ELSS\nEquity Exposure:\nInvests predominantly in equity and equity-related instruments.\nMinimum Investment:\nInvestors can start with as low as Rs. 500.\nRisk Factor:\nBeing equity-based, it comes with market risks, which can be mitigated through long-term investment.\nGrowth and Dividend Options:\nInvestors can choose between growth (capital appreciation) and dividend (periodic pay-outs) options.\nTax Efficiency:\nProvides dual tax benefits under Section 80C and through LTCG tax exemptions.",
