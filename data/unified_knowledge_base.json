In case the\nportfolio of the scheme is not rebalanced within the aforementioned mandated plus extended\ntimelines, the AMC shall follow the requirements specified under the aforesaid circular including\nreporting the deviation to Trustees at each stage.\n7. Investment Strategy\nThe investment objective of the Scheme is to provide long-term capital appreciation by investing\npredominantly in Large-Cap companies.\nThe Scheme will maintain a minimum exposure of 80% to Large- Cap stocks. The Scheme may\nalso invest upto 20% of AUM in debt and money market securities. The Scheme will remain\ndiversified across key sectors and economic variables.\nThe Scheme may also invest in the hybrid securities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for\ndiversification and subject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time.\nSubject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may engage in Stock\nLending activities.\nInvestment in debt securities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their\noutlook.\nThe Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF)\nRegulations.\nAs part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as\nfutures and options, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible\nin future under applicable regulations. However, trading in derivatives by the Scheme shall be for\nrestricted purposes as permitted by the regulations.\nFor detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI. For exposure limits to derivatives, refer\nsection ‘Where will the scheme invest’ under Section II, Part II, Clause A in the SID.\nThough every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the\nAMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be\nachieved. No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme.\n8. Risk Profile of the Scheme\n5\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\nMutual Fund Units involve investment risks including the possible loss of principal. Please read the\nSID carefully for details on risk factors before investment. Scheme specific Risk Factors are\nsummarized below:\n(i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments\n● Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a\ndaily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk\nand investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks.\n● Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and\ncarry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the\nexchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk.\n● While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell\nthese investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may\nlead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold.\n● Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments\nheld in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances.\n(ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities\n• The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money\nMarket instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The\nNAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be\nadversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates.\n• Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market,\nwhich may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring\nlosses till the security is finally sold.\n• Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term\nrating of the issuers.\n• Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e.\nthe risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or\nany other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial\nconditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes\nin economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that\nmay have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may\nincrease the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit\nrisk through in-house credit analysis.\n• Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its\nsecurities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of\nsuch prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in\nsecurities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n• Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received\nfrom the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment\nis the \"interest on interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows\ncan be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed.\n• Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement\nperiods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances.\nDelays or other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods\n6\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\nwhen the assets of the Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The\ninability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems,\ncould cause the Scheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to\nsell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and\nliquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the\nScheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in the\nScheme's portfolio.\n• Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed\nincome security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall\nand when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a\nfunction of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level\nof interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which\ngovernment raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already\ndealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government Securities. It\nexists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the\nsense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced\nonly by movement in interest rates in the financial system.\n• Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the\nScheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the\nScheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g.\ncorporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even\namong corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated\nbonds.\n• The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated /\nunrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer\nattractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio.\n• As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the\nsecurity, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to\nissuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The\nAMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may\nincrease the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations\nthat do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a\nspecified date when the securities begin paying current interest and therefore, are\ngenerally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the\ntime remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It\nalso varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the\nperceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are\ngenerally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.\n• Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: Except for any security of an\nassociate or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a\nstock exchange (“unlisted Securities”) which in general are subject to greater price\nfluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the open market.\nUnlisted debt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no assurance\nthat the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value.\n• Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value\nhigher than rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer-specific developments.\nSuch investments display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a\ndeteriorating economic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to\nbe more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities.\n7\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\n(iii) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement\n(CE) rated securities\nThe risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in\naddition to the risk factors associated with debt instruments.\n• Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit\nenhancement for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could\nbe in various forms and could include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter of comfort, etc.\nfrom another entity. This entity could be either related or non-related to the issuer like a\nbank, financial institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form\nof pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/\nmortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by hypothecation of car loan\nreceivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for\nCE rated instruments evaluation of the credit enhancement provider, as well as the issuer\nis undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan\npools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer.\n• Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit\nenhancements. Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due\nto the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities,\nthe liquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar\nrated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of\nthe scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher\nimpact cost when such instruments are sold.\n• Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the\ncombined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the\nissuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The\nweakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure\ndue to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce\nguarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases\nthe overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore, apart from\nissuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit\nrisk.\n(iv) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo\nThe mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the\nClearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government\nsecurities and in Tri-party Repo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and\nsettlement systems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks\nconsiderably for transactions in the said segments. The members are required to contribute an\namount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as\na part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any\nmember in settling transactions routed through CCIL).\nAs per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to\nthe default fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post\nutilization of CCIL's contribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default\nfund contributions of the non-defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the\n8\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\ninitial margin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any\nsettlement obligations. In addition, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the\nresidual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member).\nCCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with\na view to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades\nand the other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo\ntrades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of CCIL,\nin the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default\nlosses of another member by CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to\nits contribution to the default fund.\n(v) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities\n● Currency Risk:\nMoving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that\nthe assets of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the\nIndian Rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected\nby changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee.\n● Interest Rate Risk:\nThe pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related,\ncan differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the\nScheme stand exposed to their interest rate cycles.\n● Credit Risk:\nInvestment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet\ninterest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness\nof the issuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate\ninvestments only in debt instruments with rating not below investment grade by\naccredited/registered credit rating agency.\n● Taxation Risk:\nIn addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional\nInformation (SAI) under section “Special Consideration”, Investment in Foreign Securities\nposes additional challenges based on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction.\nThe scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual\ntaxation.\nThe Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from\nits investment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the\nchanging / evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All\nthese may entail a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc.\nthus adversely impacting its NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor.\n● Legal and Regulatory Risk:\nLegal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely\naffect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or\nregulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors\nmay be subject could differ materially from current requirements and may materially and\nadversely affect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also\nbe imposed retrospectively.\n9\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\n● Country Risk:\nThe Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the\nrisk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might\nadversely affect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include\nevents such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-\nlateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax\nlaws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of trades or otherwise.\n● To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund\nmay use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance\nwith conditions as may be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time.\n• Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities:\nIn case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by\nregulatory bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in\npermissible Overseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity.\n(vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives\n● The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in\nan attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative\nproducts are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis\ndifferent from those associated with stocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an\nunderstanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks\ninclude, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate\nperfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices.\n● Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well\nas disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the\nability of the fund manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the\nstrategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund\nmanager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will\nbe able to identify or execute such strategies.\n● The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the\nrisks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.\n● Credit Risk:\nThe credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its\nobligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative\ntransaction.\n● Market Risk:\nMarket movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives.\n● Illiquidity risk:\nThis is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due\nto lack of liquidity in the market.\nAdditional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate\nFutures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and\nthe IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the\nportfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF.\n10\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\n(vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares\n● Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of\npayment of Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non-\ncumulative preference shares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on preference\nshares in case of inadequate profits in any year.\n● Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and\nthus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity.\n● Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than\nsecured and unsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus there is\nsignificant risk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation.\n(viii) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending\nAs with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending,\nincluding the risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply\nwith the terms of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme\nand the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the\ncollateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to\nreturn the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits\naccruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The\nscheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss\nof opportunity.\n(ix) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt\nThe Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not\nrepresent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive.\n● Limited Liquidity & Price Risk\nThere is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This\ncould limit the ability of the investor to resell them.\n● Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk\nThe Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These\nCertificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not\nrepresent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any\naffiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate\nHolders against the Investors' Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause\ndepletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor\nPayouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit\nEnhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to\nrepay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However, many factors\nmay affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required to\nrealise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold\nmay be lower than the amount due from that Obligor.\n● Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs\n11\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\nIn the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also,\nany Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates\n(PTCs).\n● Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility\nIf the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor\ncould experience losses or delays in the payments.\n● Risk of Co-mingling\nWith respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the\nObligors into the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by\na Servicer and depositing the same into the Collection account especially considering that\nsome of the collections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the\nLoan Agreements may not be segregated from other funds of originator. If originator in its\ncapacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to\na potential loss.\n(x) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI)\nPerpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their\ncapital profile. Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for\nBasel III Capital Regulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are\nno regulatory guidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds\nas per guidelines issued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is\nno fixed maturity date. The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below:\nKey Risk Factors:\n- Risk on coupon servicing\nBanks\nAs per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel\ndistributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable\nreserves and surpluses or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow\nbanks to make payment of coupons.\nNBFCs\nWhile NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can\nalso be deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of\ncapital ratios.\nCorporates\nCorporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon\nis usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon\nrate of the PDI.\n- Risk of write-down or conversion into equity\nBanks\nAs per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity\nTier-1 (CET-1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get\n12\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\nwritten down. Further, AT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common\nequity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV\nis a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non-viable unless\nthere is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection\nhappens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital.\nThis risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates.\n- Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer\nBanks\nThe issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified\nperiod from the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the\nbank does not exercise the call on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the\ninstruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date.\nNBFCs\nThe NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as\nper the regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the\nRBI guidelines. However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may\nhave to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date.\nCorporates\nThere is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the\ncall option, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call\nexercise date.\n(xi) Risk factors associated with Short Selling\nShort-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade.\nInstead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the\nstock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects,\nShort seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the\ndifference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock\nappreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money\nand these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall\nresult into major losses in the portfolio.\n(xii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:\n● Price Risk:\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a\ndaily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in\ngeneral market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and\nInfrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer\nprocedures.\n13\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\n● Interest Rate Risk:\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates\nrise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n● Credit Risk:\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest\npayment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of\nREITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not\nnecessarily be pre scheduled.\n● Liquidity Risk:\nThis refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is\nno assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there\nwould be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of\nilliquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments\nfor which a liquid market exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be\nexposed to liquidity risk.\n● Reinvestment Risk:\nInvestments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there\ncould be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay-outs,\netc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns.\n● Legal and Regulatory Risk\nThe regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs\ncomprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and\nenforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast\nas to how any new laws, regulations or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers\nof REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the\nregulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply\nwith the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions.\n(xiii) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes\n1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance.\nAny change in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will\naffect the performance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes.\n2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads.\n(xiv) General Risk factors\n• Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the\ninvestments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have\ndifferent settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen\ncircumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the\nUnits of the Scheme can go up or down because of various factors that affect the capital\nmarkets in general.\n• As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading\nvolumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units\n14\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\nmay be significant in the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or\nrestructuring of the Scheme. In view of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole\ndiscretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending redemptions) under certain\ncircumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend\nRedemption of the units in the SID.\n• At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be\nable to invest in securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies\ncollected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities /\ninvestments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The\nScheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity\nrequirements.\n• Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance\nbetween the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to\nmedium term period.\n• Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments,\nwhich may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation\npolicies.\n• The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset-\nliability mismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of\nthe securities leading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in\nlower yield instruments.\nFor details on risk mitigation measures, please refer SID.\n9. Plans/ Options\nPlans: Regular & Direct\nRegular and Direct Plans offer the following options:\n(a) Growth Option\n(b) Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) Option\nUnder this Option, it is proposed to declare income / capital Distribution (IDCW) subject to\navailability of distributable surplus, as computed in accordance with SEBI (MF) Regulations.\nInvestors should note that distributions can be made out of Equalization Reserves (representing\naccumulated realized gains), which is part of sale price paid by them.\n➢ This Option offers following facilities:\n• Payout of IDCW (“Payout”) and\n• Re-investment of IDCW (“Re-investment”)\nDefault Option- Growth\nDefault Facility- Payout\nFor detailed disclosure on default plans and options, kindly refer SAI.\n10. Applicable NAV (after the scheme opens for subscriptions and redemptions)\nThe below cut-off timings and applicability of NAV shall be applicable in respect of valid\napplications received at the Official Point(s) of Acceptance on a Business Day (During Continuous\nOffer Period):\nA] For Purchase (including switch-in) of any amount:\n15\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\n● In respect of valid applications received upto 3.00 p.m. and where the funds for the entire\namount are available for utilization before the cut-off time i.e. credited to the bank account\nof the Scheme before the cut-off time - the closing NAV of the day shall be applicable.\n● In respect of valid applications received after 3.00 p.m. and where the funds for the entire\namount are credited to the bank account of the Scheme either at any time on the same day\nor before the cut-off time of the next Business Day i.e. available for utilization before the\ncut-off time of the next Business Day - the closing NAV of the next Business Day shall be\napplicable.\n● Irrespective of the time of receipt of application, where the funds for the entire amount are\ncredited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time on any subsequent\nBusiness Day i.e. available for utilization before the cut-off time on any subsequent\nBusiness Day - the closing NAV of such subsequent Business Day shall be applicable.\nB] For Switch-ins of any amount:\nFor determining the applicable NAV, the following shall be ensured:\n● Application for switch-in is received before the applicable cut-off time.\n● Funds for the entire amount of subscription/purchase as per the switch-in request are\ncredited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time.\n● The funds are available for utilization before the cut-off time.\n● In case of ‘switch’ transactions from one scheme to another, the allocation shall be in line\nwith redemption payouts.\nIn case of switches, the request should be received on a day which is a Business Day for\nthe Switch-out scheme. Redemption for switch-out shall be processed at the applicable\nNAV as per cut-off timing. Switch-in will be processed at the Applicable NAV (on a Business\nDay) based on realization of funds as per the redemption pay-out cycle for the switch-out\nscheme.\nFor investments through systematic investment routes such as Systematic Investment Plans\n(SIP), Flex SIP, Systematic Transfer Plans (STP), Flex-STP, Swing STP, Transfer of Income\nDistribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) Plan facility (TIP), etc. the units will be allotted as\nper the closing NAV of the day on which the funds are available for utilization by the Target\nScheme irrespective of the installment date of the SIP, STP or record date of IDCW etc.\nWhile the AMC will endeavour to deposit the payment instruments accompanying investment\napplication submitted to it with its bank expeditiously, it shall not be liable for delay in realization\nof funds on account of factors beyond its control such as clearing / settlement cycles of the\nbanks.\nSince different payment modes have different settlement cycles including electronic\ntransactions (as per arrangements with Payment Aggregators / Banks / Exchanges etc), it may\nhappen that the investor's account is debited, but the money is not credited within cut-off time\non the same date to the Scheme's bank account, leading to a gap / delay in Unit allotment.\nInvestors are therefore urged to use the most efficient electronic payment modes to avoid\ndelays in realization of funds and consequently in Unit allotment.\nC] For Redemption (including switch-out) applications\n● In respect of valid applications received upto 3 p.m. on a Business Day by the Fund, same\nday's closing NAV shall be applicable.\n16\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\n● In respect of valid applications received after 3 p.m. on a Business Day by the Fund, the\nclosing NAV of the next Business Day shall be applicable.\nTransactions through online facilities / electronic modes:\nThe time of transaction done through various online facilities / electronic modes offered by the\nAMC, for the purpose of determining the applicability of NAV, would be the time when the request\nfor purchase / sale / switch of units is received in the servers of AMC/RTA.\nThe AMC has the right to amend cut off timings subject to SEBI (MF) Regulations for the smooth\nand efficient functioning of the Scheme.\n11. Minimum Application Amount / Number of Units\nPurchase (including switch- Additional Purchase Redemption (including\nin) (including switch-in) switch-out)\nRs.100/- and any amount Rs.100/- and any amount Rs. 100 and in multiples of Re.\nthereafter thereafter 1/- thereafter.\nNote: Allotment of units will be Note: Allotment of units will be Note: There will be no\ndone after deduction of done after deduction of minimum redemption criterion\napplicable stamp duty and applicable stamp duty and for Unit based redemption.\nother charges, if any. other charges, if any.\n12. Despatch of Redemption Request\nWithin 3 working days of the receipt of valid redemption request at the Official Points of\nAcceptance of HDFC Mutual Fund for this Scheme or within such timelines as may be prescribed\nby SEBI / AMFI from time to time in case of exceptional circumstances or otherwise.\n13. Benchmark Index\nNIFTY 100 Total Returns Index (TRI)\n14. Dividend / IDCW Policy\nIt is proposed to declare IDCW subject to availability of distributable surplus, as computed in\naccordance with SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996.\nIDCW, if declared, will be paid (subject of deduction of tax at source, if any) to those Unitholders /\nBeneficial Owners whose names appear in the Register of Unit holders maintained by the Mutual\nFund/ statement of beneficial ownership maintained by the Depositories, as applicable, under the\nIDCW option as on the Record Date. The IDCW payment shall be transferred to the Unitholders\nwithin 7 working days of the record date of such declaration of IDCW or such other timeline as may\nbe specified by SEBI from time to time. In the event of failure to transfer IDCW within the stipulated\nperiod, the AMC shall be liable to pay interest @ 15% per annum to the Unitholders for the delay in\npayment as computed from the Record Date or from such other date or for such period as may be\nadvised by SEBI from time to time. The Trustee/ AMC reserves the right to change the record date\nfrom time to time. However, it must be distinctly understood that the actual declaration of IDCW\nand the frequency thereof will inter alia, depend on the availability of distributable surplus as\ncomputed in accordance with SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. The decision of the Trustee\nin this regard shall be final.\n17\nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM\nThere is no assurance or guarantee to unit holders as to the rate of IDCW distribution nor that\nIDCW will be paid regularly. On payment of IDCW, the NAV will stand reduced by the amount of\nIDCW and IDCW tax (if applicable) paid.\n15.

It must be clearly understood that the percentages stated above are only indicative and not absolute\nand that they can vary substantially depending upon the perception of the Investment Manager, the intention\nbeing at all times to seek to protect the interests of the Unit holders. As per clause 1.14.1.2.b of Master\nCircular, as may be amended from time to time, such changes in the investment pattern will be for short term\nand for defensive consideration only.\nIn the event of change in the asset allocation, the fund manager will carry out portfolio rebalancing within 30\ncalendar days or such other timeline as may be prescribed by SEBI from time to time.\nPortfolio rebalancing (in case of passive breaches):\nAs per clause 2.9 of Master Circular, as may be amended/ clarified from time to time, in the event of change\nin the asset allocation due to passive breaches (occurrence of instances not arising out of omission and\ncommission of the AMC), the fund manager is required to carry out portfolio rebalancing within 30 Business\nDays.\nIn case the portfolio is not rebalanced within the period of 30 Business days, justification in writing, including\ndetails of efforts taken to rebalance the portfolio shall be placed before the Investment Committee.

In case the portfolio of the scheme is not\nrebalanced within the aforementioned mandated plus extended timelines, the AMC shall follow the\nrequirements specified under the aforesaid circular including reporting the deviation to Trustees at each\nstage.\nB. WHERE WILL THE SCHEME INVEST?\nThe Scheme will invest in securities as mentioned below. The investments will be made as per the limits\nspecified in the asset allocation table of the Scheme, subject to permissible limits laid under SEBI (MF)\nRegulations or any other applicable laws and guidelines.\n• Equity and equity related instruments\n• Debt and Money Market Instruments\n• Short Term deposits\n• Units of mutual funds\n• REITs and InvITs\n• Derivatives\n• Investment in overseas securities shall be made in accordance with the requirements stipulated by SEBI\nand RBI from time to time.\nAny other instruments as may be permitted by RBI / SEBI from time to time, subject to necessary\nregulatory approvals.\n13\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\nFor detailed disclosures, kindly refer Section II.\nC. WHAT ARE THE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES?\nThe investment objective of the Scheme is to provide long-term capital appreciation by investing\npredominantly in Large-Cap companies.\nThe Scheme will maintain a minimum exposure of 80% to Large- Cap stocks. The Scheme may also invest\nupto 20% of AUM in debt and money market securities. The Scheme will remain diversified across key sectors\nand economic variables.\nThe Scheme may also invest in the hybrid securities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for diversification and\nsubject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time.\nSubject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may engage in Stock Lending activities.\nInvestment in debt securities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their outlook.\nThe Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF)\nRegulations.\nAs part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as futures and\noptions, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible in future under\napplicable regulations. However, trading in derivatives by the Scheme shall be for restricted purposes as\npermitted by the regulations.\nFor detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI. For exposure limits to derivatives, refer section ‘Where\nwill the scheme invest’ under Section II, Part II, Clause A\nThough every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the\nAMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved.\nNo guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme.\nRisk Control\nInvestments made by the Scheme would be in accordance with the investment objectives of the scheme and\nprovisions of SEBI (MF) Regulations. Since investing requires disciplined risk management, the AMC would\nincorporate adequate safeguards for controlling risks in the portfolio construction process. The risk control\nprocess involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes that this\ndiversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use\nvarious derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time,\nwith an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest. While these measures\nare expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would\nbe completely eliminated.\nPORTFOLIO TURNOVER\nThe Scheme is an open-ended Scheme. The portfolio is managed from a long term perspective with an\nendeavour to keep portfolio turnover ratio low. However, it is expected that there would be a number of\nsubscriptions and redemptions on a daily basis. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable\nmeasure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage\nand transaction cost.\n14\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\nD. HOW WILL THE SCHEME BENCHMARK ITS PERFORMANCE?\nNIFTY 100 Total Returns Index (TRI)\nAs required under clause 1.9 of Master Circular, the benchmark has been selected from amongst those\nnotified by AMFI as the first tier benchmark to be adopted by mutual funds and which are reflective of the\ncategory of the scheme.\nNIFTY 100 is a diversified 100 stock index representing major sectors of the economy. This index intends to\nmeasure the performance of large market capitalisation companies. The performance will be benchmarked\nto the Total Returns Variant of the Index.\nThe Trustee reserves the right to change the benchmark for evaluation of performance of the Scheme from\ntime to time in conformity with the investment objectives and appropriateness of the benchmark subject to\nSEBI (MF) Regulations, and other prevailing guidelines, if any.\nE.

OTHER DETAILS\nA. COMPUTATION OF NAV\nMethodology for Computation of NAV:\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) per Unit of the Scheme will be computed by dividing the net assets of the Scheme\nby the number of Units outstanding under the Scheme on the valuation date. The AMC will value its\ninvestments according to the valuation norms, as specified in Schedule VIII of the SEBI (MF) Regulations, or\nsuch norms as may be specified by SEBI from time to time and as stipulated in the Valuation Policy and\nProcedures of the Fund, provided in SAI available on website.\nIn case of any conflict between the Principles of Fair Valuation and valuation guidelines specified by SEBI,\nthe Principles of Fair Valuation shall prevail.\nNAV of Units under each Scheme/ Plan shall be calculated as shown below:\n20\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\nMarket or Fair Value of the Scheme’s Investments\n+ Current Assets\nNAV (Rs.) - Current Liabilities and Provisions\n= _______________________________________________\nper Unit\nNo. of Units outstanding under the\nScheme/Plan\nThe NAV of the Scheme will be calculated and disclosed at the close of every Business Day.\nSeparate NAV will be calculated and announced for each of Plans/Options. The NAVs will be calculated upto\n3 decimals. Units will be allotted upto 3 decimals.\nIllustration for Computation of NAV:\nNAV for the Scheme shall be calculated as shown below:\nParticulars Amount (In INR)\nAssets\nInvestments (at Market Value) 10,000\n(Equity/Debt/Derivatives)\nCurrent Assets\nInterest receivable 1,000\nDividend Receivables 550\nTrades Receivables 1,500\nTotal Assets (A) 13,050\nCurrent Liabilities\nTrade Payables 1,500\nExpense Payable 25\nDividend payable 25\nTotal Liabilities (B) 1,550\nNet Assets (C) (A – B) 11,500\nUnits Outstanding (D) 1,000\nNAV per unit (C/D) ₹ 11.50\nMETHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATION OF SALE AND REPURCHASE PRICE\n21\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\n• Ongoing Price for subscription (purchase)/ switch-in (from other schemes/ plans of the mutual fund)\nby investors. (This is the price you need to pay for purchase/ switch-in):\nThe Sale Price for a valid purchase will be the Applicable NAV.\ni.e. Sale Price = Applicable NAV\nFor a valid purchase request of Rs. 10,000 where the applicable NAV is Rs. 11.1234, the units allotted will\nbe:\n= 10,000 (i.e. purchase amount)\n11.1234 (i.e. applicable NAV)\n= 899.006 units (rounded to three decimals)\nCharges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above\nillustration.\n• Ongoing Price for redemption (sale)/ switch-outs (to other schemes/plans of the mutual fund) by\ninvestors. (This is the price you will receive for redemptions/ switch-outs):\nThe Repurchase Price for a valid repurchase will be the applicable NAV reduced by any exit load (say 1%).\ni.e. applicable NAV - (applicable NAV X applicable exit load).\nFor a valid repurchase request where the applicable NAV is Rs. 12.1234, the repurchase price will be:\n= 12.1234 - (12.1234 X 1.00%)\n= 12.1234 - 0.1212\n= Rs. 12.0022\nTherefore, for a repurchase of 899.006 units, the proceeds received by the investor will be -\n= 899.006 (units) * 12.0022 (Repurchase price)\n= Rs. 10,790.02 (rounded to two decimals)\nCharges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above\nillustration.\nWhile determining the price of the units, the mutual fund shall ensure that the repurchase price of an open\nended scheme is not lower than 95 per cent of the Net Asset Value.\nFor other details such as policies with respect to computation of NAV, rounding off, investment in foreign\nsecurities, procedure in case of delay in disclosure of NAV etc. refer to SAI.\nB.

DEFINITIONS / INTERPRETATION\nVisit: https://www.hdfcfund.com/statutory-disclosure/offer-document-disclosures\nB. RISK FACTORS\n■ Scheme Specific Risk Factors:\nSome of the specific risk factors related to the Scheme include, but are not limited to the following:\n(i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments\n● Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis.\nInvestments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and investors should\nnot invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks.\n● Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger\namount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment in such\nsecurities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk.\n● While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these\ninvestments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme\nincurring losses till the security is finally sold.\n● Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in the\ndebt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances.\n(ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities\n• The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market\ninstruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme\nis expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase\nin the level of interest rates.\n• Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may\nrestrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security\nis finally sold.\n• Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of\nthe issuers.\n• Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of\nan issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which\nmay have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in\neconomic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions\nspecific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit\nquality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will\nendeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis.\n• Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities\nbefore their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such prepayment\nmay force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields,\nresulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n• Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the\nsecurities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on\n27\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\ninterest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be\nlower than that originally assumed.\n• Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and\nsuch periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems\nin settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are\nuninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities\npurchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment\nopportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the\nabsence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in\npotential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in\nthe Scheme's portfolio.\n• Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed income\nsecurity. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest\nrates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing\ncoupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of\ninterest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels\nat which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government\nSecurities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the\nsense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by\nmovement in interest rates in the financial system.\n• Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme\nInformation Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may\nincrease or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level\nof risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are\ncomparatively less risky than AA rated bonds.\n• The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated\nsecurities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may\nincrease the absolute level of risk of the portfolio.\n• As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these\nsecurities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk.\nTherefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in\nzero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero\ncoupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic\npayment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current\ninterest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount\ndepends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest.\nIt also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived\ncredit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than\nthe market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.\n• Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: Except for any security of an associate\nor group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a stock exchange\n(“unlisted Securities”) which in general are subject to greater price fluctuations, less liquidity and\ngreater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid\nsecondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in\nunlisted securities at a fair value.\n• Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than\nrated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer-specific developments. Such investments\ndisplay increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic\nenvironment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities\ntend to be less liquid than rated debt securities.\n28\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\n(iii) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE) rated\nsecurities\nThe risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition to the\nrisk factors associated with debt instruments.\n• Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement\nfor the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in various forms and\ncould include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter of comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity\ncould be either related or non-related to the issuer like a bank, financial institution, etc. Credit\nenhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges,\netc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by\nhypothecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables\netc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluation of the credit enhancement provider, as well as the\nissuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan\npools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer.\n• Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit\nenhancements. Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit\nenhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the liquidity in the\nmarket for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt instruments. Hence,\nlower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments\nand generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold.\n• Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength\nof the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could\nhave an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to\ninability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the\nunderlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk\nof servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore,\napart from issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit\nrisk.\n(iv) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo\nThe mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing\nCorporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri-party\nRepo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL;\nThus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments.\nThe members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the\ndefault fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in\ncase of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL).\nAs per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default\nfund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL's\ncontribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non-\ndefaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution\nbeing invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In addition, the fund contribution is\nallowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting\nmember).\nCCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to\nmeet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and the other for\nmeeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades. The mutual fund is\nexposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of\n29\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\nthe mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by CCIL, as a result\nthe scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund.\n(v) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities\n● Currency Risk:\nMoving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets\nof the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the Indian Rupee\nequivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value\nof certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee.\n● Interest Rate Risk:\nThe pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related, can differ\nsignificantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed to\ntheir interest rate cycles.\n● Credit Risk:\nInvestment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and\nprincipal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is\nsubstantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in debt instruments with\nrating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency.\n● Taxation Risk:\nIn addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information (SAI)\nunder section “Special Consideration”, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges\nbased on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher\nlevel of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation.\nThe Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its\ninvestment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing /\nevolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All these may entail a\nhigher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting its\nNAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor.\n● Legal and Regulatory Risk:\nLegal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it.\nIf any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should\nbe enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject could differ\nmaterially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the\ninvestors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively.\n● Country Risk:\nThe Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk\nencompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect\nforeign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction\nof extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of\nthe overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of\ntrades or otherwise.\n● To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use\nderivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may\nbe stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time.\n• Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities:\n30\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\nIn case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by regulatory\nbodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in permissible Overseas\nSecurities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity.\n(vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives\n● The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an attempt\nto protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products are specialized\ninstruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those associated with\nstocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument\nbut of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability\nof derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices.\n● Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as\ndisproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund\nmanager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the\nfund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No\nassurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies.\n● The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks\nassociated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.\n● Credit Risk:\nThe credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and\nis generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction.\n● Market Risk:\nMarket movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives.\n● Illiquidity risk:\nThis is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of\nliquidity in the market.\nAdditional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate Futures\n(IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used\nto hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the\ngain from the hedge position entered using the IRF.\n(vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares\n● Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of\nDividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non-cumulative preference\nshares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on preference shares in case of inadequate profits\nin any year.\n● Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we\nmay be forced to hold the instrument till maturity.\n● Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured and\nunsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus there is significant risk of capital\nerosion in case the company goes into liquidation.\n(viii) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending\nAs with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the\nrisk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the\nagreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary.\n31\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\nSuch failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities,\nthe inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible\nloss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved\nintermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity\n& loss of opportunity.\n(ix) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt\nThe Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent\nthat the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive.\n● Limited Liquidity & Price Risk\nThere is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the\nability of the investor to resell them.\n● Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk\nThe Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates\nrepresent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation\nof either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and\nOriginator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors'\nRepresentative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the\nCredit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the\namount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent\ndefault of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However,\nmany factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required\nto realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may\nbe lower than the amount due from that Obligor.\n● Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs\nIn the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge\nOffs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs).\n● Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility\nIf the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor could\nexperience losses or delays in the payments.\n● Risk of Co-mingling\nWith respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the\nCollection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing\nthe same into the Collection account especially considering that some of the collections may be in the\nform of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from\nother funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors,\nthe Investors may be exposed to a potential loss.\n(x) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI)\nPerpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile.\nSome of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital\nRegulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory guidelines for\nissuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds as per guidelines issued by RBI. The\ninstruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated\nwith these instruments are highlighted below:\nKey Risk Factors:\n32\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\n- Risk on coupon servicing\nBanks\nAs per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/\npayment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses\nor inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow banks to make payment of\ncoupons.\nNBFCs\nWhile NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can also be\ndeferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios.\nCorporates\nCorporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually\ncumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI.\n- Risk of write-down or conversion into equity\nBanks\nAs per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET-\n1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written down. Further,\nAT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in\nthe event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank\nis deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds\nor a public sector capital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector\ninjection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates.\n- Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer\nBanks\nThe issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period from the\ndate of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does not exercise the\ncall on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call\nexercise date.\nNBFCs\nThe NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per the\nregulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines.\nHowever, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have to hold the instruments\nfor a period beyond the first call exercise date.\nCorporates\nThere is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the call option,\nthe Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise date.\n(xi) Risk factors associated with Short Selling\nShort-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he\nborrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and\nreturns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock\n33\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\nback for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price\nand the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short\npositions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price\nincreases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio.\n(xii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:\n● Price Risk:\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis\nowing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market\nconditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of\ninterest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures.\n● Interest Rate Risk:\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise,\nprices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n● Credit Risk:\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or\neven on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are\nlikely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled.\n● Liquidity Risk:\nThis refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no\nassurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time\nwhen trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a\ndiscount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments for which a liquid market exists. As\nthese products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk.\n● Reinvestment Risk:\nInvestments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be\nrepatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay-outs, etc. Consequently,\nthe proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns.\n● Legal and Regulatory Risk\nThe regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs comprises\na relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators\nand courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new laws, regulations\nor standards or future amendments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole.\nFurthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way that will\nimpair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively\nor make distributions.\n(xiii) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes\n1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any\nchange in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the\nperformance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes.\n2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads.\n34\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\n(xiv) General Risk factors\n• Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments\nmade by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods\nand such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt\nof proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down because of\nvarious factors that affect the capital markets in general.\n• As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes\nand settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be significant in\nthe event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view\nof the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending\nredemptions) under certain circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption\nand / or Suspend Redemption of the units.\n• At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest\nin securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash\nor cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to\nsubstantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments\nin cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity requirements.\n• Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the\nportfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to medium term period.\n• Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may\ninclude changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies.\n• The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset-liability\nmismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities\nleading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments.\nC. RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES\nRisk Mitigation measures for investments in equity / equity related and debt instruments\n• The Scheme will maintain a minimum exposure of 80% to Large-Cap stocks. These stocks are\ncharacterised by a high level of trading volumes imparting relatively high liquidity to the portfolio.\n• Within its investment universe, the Scheme aims to maintain a well-diversified equity portfolio\ncomprising stocks across various sectors of the economy. This shall aid in managing concentration\nrisk and sector specific risks.\n• Any investments in debt securities would be undertaken after assessing the associated credit risk,\ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk.\nCredit Evaluation Policy\nThe credit evaluation policy of the AMC entails evaluation of credit fundamentals of each investment\nopportunity. Some of the factors that are evaluated inter-alia may include outlook on the sector, parentage,\nquality of management, and overall financial strength of the credit. The AMC utilises ratings of recognized\nrating agencies as an input in the credit evaluation process. Investments in bonds and debenture are usually\nin instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by a recognized rating agency.\nIn line with clause 12.12 of Master Circular, the AMC may constitute committee(s) to approve proposals for\ninvestments in unrated instruments. The AMC Board and the Trustee shall approve the detailed parameters\nfor such investments. The details of such investments would be communicated by the AMC to the Trustee in\ntheir periodical reports. It would also be clearly mentioned in the reports, how the parameters have been\n35\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\ncomplied with. However, in case any security does not fall under the parameters, the prior approval of Board\nof AMC and Trustee shall be sought.\nLiquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to sell / liquidate a security at short notice at\nprevailing market prices or without incurring impact cost. While government bonds, money market\ninstruments and shorter maturity instruments are generally easier to sell, corporate bonds and other\ninstruments typically face higher liquidity risk. Further, higher rated securities normally are more liquid\ncompared to lower rated securities. As a result, different portfolios will face different levels of liquidity risk\nbased on the underlying portfolio composition. Some of the strategies to reduce liquidity risk are creating\nportfolios that are diversified across maturities, ratings, types of securities, etc. in line with the fund\nobjectives, regulations and investment strategy.\nCredit Risk: Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities. Hence,\ncredit risk faced by different schemes will be different based on the underlying portfolio / investment\nstrategy. To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be\nundertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors\n(parentage, track record etc.). Each of the scheme/portfolio will endeavour to maintain adequate\ndiversification across issuers / sectors in line with scheme objectives, regulations and investment\nstrategy. Unrated investments, if any, would require specific approval from a committee constituted for\nthe purpose.\nDebt Derivatives Risk: The AMC has provision for using derivative instruments for portfolio balancing\nand hedging purposes. Interest Rate Swaps will be done with approved counter parties under pre\napproved ISDA agreements. Mark to Market of swaps, netting off of cash flow and default provision\nclauses will be provided as per standard practice on a reciprocal basis. Interest Rate Swaps and other\nderivative instruments will be used as per local (RBI and SEBI) regulatory guidelines.\nInterest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk of change in the NAVs due to change in overall market\nyields. The change in value of a security, for a given change in yield, is higher for a security with higher\nduration and vice versa. Hence portfolios with higher duration will have higher volatility. The AMC shall\nstrive to actively manage the duration of the respective funds based on the prevailing market conditions\n/ outlook of interest rates, keeping in mind the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable\nregulations.\nConcentration Risk: The AMC will attempt to mitigate this risk by maintaining adequate diversification\nacross issuers/ sectors / instrument type in line with the scheme objectives, investment strategy and\napplicable regulations. This will also be managed by keeping prudent investment limits on any particular\nindustry or issuer or issuer group based on the size, credit profile, etc. to reduce issuer or industry specific\nrisk.\nRisk Mitigation measures for investments in Non-Convertible Preference Shares:\nCredit Risk - To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer\nwill be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative\nfactors (parentage, track record etc.).\nLiquidity Risk - The Fund endeavours to invest in preference shares of those companies which have\nrelatively better market acceptability amongst market participants that increases the probability of\nsecondary sale in case an exit from the investment is required.\nUnsecured in nature - The Fund endeavours to mitigate this risk by exercising due diligence while\nassessing the business, financial and management risks of the company before investing.\nRisk Mitigation factors relating to investment in Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI):\n36\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\n• Risk on coupon servicing and Risk of write-down or conversion into equity\nBanks: The risks on coupon servicing or principal write down/ conversion to equity are mitigated, to a certain\nextent, if the investee bank has strong financial position and meets the required regulatory guidelines. Hence,\nan in-depth credit evaluation of each bank is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage,\nprofitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.).\nGiven the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable\nsurplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed.\nInvestment is done only in the AT-1 bonds of banks with strong credit worthiness, in our assessment. This,\nin turn, reduces the risk of its capital position falling below regulatory requirements and / or reaching PONV.\nRisk of write-down or conversion into equity is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates.\n• Risk on coupon servicing\nNBFCs\nThese risks are mitigated, to certain extent, if the investee NBFC has strong financial position and meets the\nrequired regulatory guidelines. Hence, an in-depth credit evaluation of each NBFC is undertaken, keeping in\nmind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors\n(parentage, track record etc.). Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track\nrecord of profitability, distributable surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to\ninfuse capital, in case it is needed.\nCorporates\nTo mitigate this risk, an in-depth credit evaluation of each corporate is undertaken, keeping in mind both\nquantitative (leverage, profitability, industry position, market share etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage,\ntrack record etc.). Additionally, given that the coupon is usually cumulative in nature and the corporate is\nrestricted from paying any dividends till all previous dues are paid to the perpetual bond investor, the company\nhas adequate incentive to not defer coupon on PDIs.\n• Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer\nBanks\nWhile the issuer bank does have an option to not exercise the first call, experience suggests that all Indian\nbanks till now have exercised the call option during the call period. We believe that banks are cognizant of\nthe investor sensitivities with regards to risk of not exercising the call option at the first call date. Further, as\nwe invest in issuers with sound credit worthiness, we expect them to understand the importance of exercising\nthe call as the part of their long term capital raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of call option exercise\ncan lead to increase in cost of AT1 bonds for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond\ntenors) and impact the bank's profitability adversely. Given the importance of AT1 instruments for prudently\nmanaging the capital levels and improving the returns for the equity holders, we are of the opinion that banks\nwould choose to service the interest on AT1 bonds and exercise the first call option on AT1 bonds, as they\nhave done in the past. Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual instrument on first call date\n(say due to market disruption), the annual call on these instruments would enable the bank to call the bond\non any of the subsequent annual call options dates.\nNBFCs and Corporates\nWhile the issuer is not obligated to exercise the call option on first call date, the coupon step-up usually\nprovides financial incentive to the Issuer to exercise the call option. Further, as we invest in issuer with sound\ncredit worthiness, we expect them to be cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to exercising the\ncall as the part of their long term resource raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of first call option exercise\ncan lead to increase in cost of PDI for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond tenors)\nand impact the issuer's profitability adversely. Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual\n37\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\ninstrument on first call date (say due to market disruption), the coupon step up also compensates the investor\nfor extended holding period.\nWhile these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance\nthat these risks would be completely eliminated.\nII.

Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs),\nthe proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator. In this manner, the originator, by selling\nhis loan receivables to an SPV, receives consideration from investors much before the maturity of the\nunderlying loans. Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying loans from borrowers. Typically,\nthe transaction is provided with a limited amount of credit enhancement (as stipulated by the rating agency\nfor a target rating), which provides protection to investors against defaults by the underlying borrowers.\nGenerally available asset classes for securitisation in India are:\n● Commercial vehicles\n● Auto and two wheeler pools\n● Mortgage pools (residential housing loans)\n● Personal loan, credit card and other retail loans\n● Corporate loans/receivables\nInvestment / Risk Mitigation Strategy\n1. Risk profile of securitised debt vis-à-vis risk appetite of the Scheme\nThe risk profile of securitised debt is generally at par with the risk profile of other debt securities at the\nsame level of credit rating. Securitised debt offers additional income (spread) over a debt security of\nsimilar rating and maturity, which enables the scheme to optimize its income without taking any additional\ncredit risk. Securitised debt is generally less liquid, however, investment in securitised debt is made to\nmaintain a diversified portfolio of debt securities that optimizes return without increasing the overall risk\nprofile of the Scheme.\n2. Policy relating to originators based on nature of originator, track record, NPAs, losses in earlier\nsecuritised debt, etc\nThe originator is an entity (like banks, non-banking finance companies, corporates etc), which has initially\nprovided the loan & is also generally responsible for servicing the loans. The schemes will invest in\nsecuritised debt of originators with at least investment grade credit rating and established track record. A\ndetailed evaluation of originator is done before the investment is made in securitised debt of any originator\non various parameters given below:\n● Track record\nThe investment in securitised debt is done based on origination and underwriting process and\ncapabilities of the originator, overview of corporate structure, group to which they belong, experience\nof the company in the business & how long they have been in the business, financial condition of the\ncompany, credit rating, past performance of similar pools by the originator, etc.\n● Willingness to pay through credit enhancement facilities etc.\nCredit enhancement is provided by the originator, as indicated by rating agencies, so as to adequately\ncover the defaults and acts as a risk mitigation measure. The size of the credit enhancement as\nindicated by rating agency depends on the originator's track record, past delinquencies, pattern of the\nportfolio & characteristics of the pool vis-a-vis of the portfolio, nature of the asset class.\n● Ability to pay\nThe quality of the origination impacts the performance of the underlying asset & thus originators with\nstrong systems and processes in place can eliminate poor quality assets. A robust risk management\nsystem of the originator and availability of MIS reports on timely basis, results in creation of strong\nasset portfolio.\n● Business Risk Assessment\n41\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\nThe business risk assessment of originator / underlying borrower also includes detailed credit\nassessment wherein following factors are also considered:\n- Outlook for the economy (domestic and global)\n- Outlook for the industry\n- Company specific factors\nIn addition, a detailed review and assessment of rating rationale is done along with interactions with\nthe company as well as the rating agency. All investment in securitised debt is done after taking into\naccount, the Critical Evaluation Parameters (for pool loan and single loan securitisation transactions)\nregarding the originator / underlying issuer as mentioned below:\n● Default track record/ frequent alteration of redemption conditions / covenants\n● High leverage ratios of the ultimate borrower (for single-sell downs) - both on a standalone basis\nas well on a consolidated level/ group level\n● Higher proportion of reschedulement of underlying assets of the pool or loan, as the case may be\n● Higher proportion of overdue assets of the pool or the underlying loan, as the case may be\n● Poor reputation in market\n● Insufficient track record of servicing of the pool or the loan, as the case may be.\n3. Risk mitigation strategies for investments with each kind of originator\nInvestments are based on assessment of following parameters, so as to mitigate risk associated with\nsuch investment:\na. Credit quality, size and reach of the originator\nb. Nature of receivables/asset category i.e. cars, construction equipment, commercial vehicles, personal\nloans etc.\nc. Collection process, infrastructure and follow-up mechanism\nd. Quality of MIS\ne. Credit cum liquidity enhancement\nf. Credit appraisal norms of originator\ng. Asset Quality - portfolio delinquency levels\nh. Past performance of rated pools\ni. Pool Characteristics - seasoning, Loan-to-value ratios, geographic diversity etc.\n4. The level of diversification with respect to the underlying assets, and risk mitigation measures for\nless diversified investments\nDiversification of underlying assets is achieved through a) prudent mix of asset categories - i.e. cars (new,\nused), commercial vehicles, construction equipment, unsecured loans to individuals or small & medium\nenterprises b) total number of contracts in a pool c) average ticket size of loans and d) geographical\ndistribution.\nRisk mitigation measures for less diversified investments in pools is accomplished through the size of\ncredit enhancement, seasoning or loan to value ratios.\nIllustrative framework, which will be applied while evaluating investment decision relating to a pool\nsecuritisation transaction:\nCharacteristics/ Mortgage Commercial Car 2 Micro Personal Single Others\nType of Pool Loan Vehicle and wheelers Finance Loans Sell\nConstruction Pools Downs\nEquipment\nApproximate\n12-60 8-40 Refer Refer\nAverage maturity (in NA 12-60 months NA NA\nmonths months Note A Note B\nMonths)\n42\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\nCollateral margin\n(including cash,\nguarantees, excess NA 5-20% 4-15% 4-15% NA NA\ninterest spread,\nsubordinate tranche)\nAverage Loan to\nNA 80-95% 70-90% 70-95% NA NA\nValue Ratio\nAverage seasoning 3-8 2-5\nNA 3-8 months NA NA\nof the Pool months months\nMaximum single NA NA\nexposure range NA 3-7% (Retail (Retail NA NA\npool) Pool)\nAverage single\nNA 1-5% 0-1% 0-1% NA NA\nexposure range %\nNA - Not Applicable\nInformation in the table above is based on current scenario and is subject to change depending upon the\nchange in related factors.\nNotes:\nA. In case of securitised debt with underlying being single loan, the investment limit applicable to the\nunderlying borrower is considered.\nB. Other investment will be decided on a case to case basis.\nIn case of asset backed pools (ABS), evaluation of the pool assets is done considering the following\nfactors: (Refer the table above which illustrates the averages of parameters considered while selecting\nthe pool)\n• Size of the loan\n• Average original maturity of the pool\n• Loan to Value Ratio\n• Average seasoning of the pool\n• Default rate distribution\n• Geographical Distribution\n• Credit enhancement facility\n• Liquid facility\n• Structure of the pool\n5. Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation\nThe illustrative average seasoning of the debt by originator prior to securitisation is given above in table\n(Refer Point 4).\nMinimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation in the case of asset pools is in\nthe form of seasoning of loans to various asset classes (cars, commercial vehicles, etc.) and generally\nvaries from one month to six months depending on the nature of asset.\n6. Minimum retention percentage by originator of debts to be securitised\n43\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\nWhile minimum retention percentage by originator is not prescribed, any amount retained by the originator\nthrough subordination is viewed positively at the time of making investment and generally varies from 5%\nto 10%.\n7. The mechanism to tackle conflict of interest when the mutual fund invests in securitised debt of\nan originator and the originator in turn makes investments in that particular scheme of the fund\nAll proposals for investment in securitised debt are evaluated by the credit analyst based on several\nparameters such as nature of underlying asset category, pool characteristics, asset quality, credit rating\nof the securitisation transaction, and credit cum liquidity enhancement available. Investment in securitised\ndebt in any scheme is made by the respective fund manager in line with the investment objective of that\nscheme.\n8. The resources and mechanism of individual risk assessment with the AMC for monitoring\ninvestment in securitised debt (in general)\nInvestment in securitised debt is monitored regularly with regards to its performance on various\nparameters such as collection efficiency, delinquencies, prepayments and utilization of credit\nenhancement. Information on these parameters is available through monthly reports from Pool Trustees\nand through information disseminated by the rating agencies. Monthly performance report is released by\nthe credit analyst to the fund management team and the fund management team periodically reviews the\nsame.\nTrading in Derivatives\n• The Scheme may take derivatives position based on the opportunities available subject to the guidelines\nprovided by SEBI from time to time and in line with the overall investment objective of the Scheme.\n• The Scheme intends to use derivatives mainly for the purpose of hedging and portfolio balancing. Losses\nmay arise as a result of using derivatives, but these are likely to be compensated by the gains on the\nunderlying cash instruments held by the Scheme.\n• The Scheme may take position in derivative instruments like Futures, Options, and such other derivative\ninstruments as may be permitted by SEBI from time to time.\nExposure to Derivatives\nThe exposure limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by SEBI vide its clause 12.25 of\nMaster Circular and as amended from time to time are as follows:\nPosition Limits\nThe position limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by clause 12.25 of Master circular\nread with SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-2/P/CIR/2024/140 dated October 15, 2024 as\namended from time to time are as follows:\ni.

This position limits shall be applicable on the combined position in all derivative contracts on an\nunderlying stock at a Stock Exchange.\n3. For index based contracts, Mutual Funds shall disclose the total open interest held by its scheme\nor all schemes put together in a particular underlying index, if such open interest equals to or\nexceeds 15% of the open interest of all derivative contracts on that underlying index.\nExposure Limits\nThe exposure limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by clauses 12.24 and 12.25\nof Master Circular, are as follows:\n1.

Security wise hedge positions using\nderivatives such as Interest Rate Swaps, call options written under the covered call Strategy and\nany other positions specifically exempted under SEBI guidelines from time to time, will not be\nconsidered in calculating above exposure.\n2. Mutual Funds shall not write options or purchase instruments with em-bedded written options\n(except for exposure on account of call option written under the covered call strategy, if permitted\nunder the Scheme).\n45\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\n3. The total exposure related to option premium paid must not exceed 20% of the net assets of the\nscheme.\n4. Cash or cash equivalents i.e. Government Securities, T-Bills and Repo on Government Securities\nhaving residual maturity of less than 91 days may be treated as not creating any exposure.\n5. Exposure due to hedging positions may not be included in the above mentioned limits subject to\nthe following:\na) Hedging positions are the derivative positions that reduce possible losses on an existing\nposition in securities and till the existing position remains.\nb) Hedging positions cannot be taken for existing derivative positions. Exposure due to such\npositions shall have to be added and treated under limits mentioned in Point 1.\nc) Any derivative instrument used to hedge has the same underlying security as the existing\nposition being hedged.\nd) The quantity of underlying associated with the derivative position taken for hedging\npurposes does not exceed the quantity of the existing position against which hedge has\nbeen taken.\n6. (a) Mutual Funds may enter into plain vanilla Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) for hedging purposes. The\nvalue of the notional principal in such cases must not exceed the value of respective existing assets\nbeing hedged by the scheme.\n(b) In case of participation in IRS is through over the counter transactions, the counter party has to\nbe an entity recognized as a market maker by RBI and exposure to a single counterparty in such\ntransactions should not exceed 10% of the net assets of the scheme.

Exposure due to derivative positions taken for hedging purposes in excess of the underlying\nposition against which the hedging position has been taken, shall be treated under the limits\nmentioned in point 1.\n8. Definition of Exposure in case of Derivative Positions\nEach position taken in derivatives shall have an associated exposure as defined under. Exposure\nis the maximum possible loss that may occur on a position. However, certain derivative positions\nmay theoretically have unlimited possible loss. Exposure in derivative positions shall be computed\nas follows:\nPosition Exposure\nLong Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts\nShort Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts\nOption Bought Option Premium Paid * Lot Size * Number of Contracts\nExposure limits on Credit Default Swaps (CDS)\n46\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\nExposure through CDS (Notional amount of both CDS bought and sold) shall not exceed 10% of AUM of\nscheme and shall be within the overall limit of derivatives.\nExposure limits on Interest Rate Futures (IRF)\nThe exposure limits for trading in Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) by Mutual Funds specified by clause\n12.25.9 of Master Circular are as follows:\ni. To reduce interest rate risk in a debt portfolio, mutual funds may hedge the portfolio or part of the\nportfolio (including one or more securities) on weighted average modified duration basis by using\nInterest Rate Futures (IRFs). The maximum extent of short position that may be taken in IRFs to hedge\ninterest rate risk of the portfolio or part of the portfolio, is as per the formula given below:\n(Portfolio Modified Duration*\nMarket Value of the Portfolio)\n(Futures Modified Duration *Futures Price/PAR)\nii. In case the IRF used for hedging the interest rate risk has different underlying security(s) than the\nexisting position being hedged, it would result in imperfect hedging.\niii. Imperfect hedging using IRFs may be considered to be exempted from the gross exposure, upto\nmaximum of 20% of the net assets of the scheme, subject to the following:\na) Exposure to IRFs is created only for hedging the interest rate risk based on the weighted average\nmodified duration of the bond portfolio or part of the portfolio.\nb) Mutual Funds are permitted to resort to imperfect hedging, without it being considered under the\ngross exposure limits, if and only if, the correlation between the portfolio or part of the portfolio\n(excluding the hedged portions, if any) and the IRF is atleast 0.9 at the time of initiation of hedge.\nIn case of any subsequent deviation from the correlation criteria, the same may be rebalanced\nwithin 5 working days and if not rebalanced within the timeline, the derivative positions created for\nhedging shall be considered under the gross exposure computed in terms of clause 12.24.1 of\nMaster Circular. The correlation should be calculated for a period of last 90 days.\nExplanation: If the fund manager intends to do imperfect hedging upto 15% of the portfolio using\nIRFs on weighted average modified duration basis, either of the following conditions need to be\ncomplied with:\ni. The correlation for past 90 days between the portfolio and the IRF is at least 0.9 or\nii. The correlation for past 90 days between the part of the portfolio (excluding the hedged\nportions, if any) i.e. at least 15% of the net asset of the scheme (including one or more\nsecurities) and the IRF is at least 0.9.\nc) At no point of time, the net modified duration of part of the portfolio being hedged should be\nnegative.\nd) The portion of imperfect hedging in excess of 20% of the net assets of the scheme should be\nconsidered as creating exposure and shall be included in the computation of gross exposure in\nterms of clause 12.24.1 of Master Circular.\n• Debt Market In India\nThe instruments available in Indian Debt Market are classified into two categories, namely Government and\nNon - Government debt. The instruments available in these categories include:\nA] Government Debt\n47\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\nCentral Government Debt\nTreasury Bills\nDated Government Securities\n– Coupon Bearing Bonds\n– Floating Rate Bonds\n– Zero Coupon Bonds\nState Government Debt\n– State Government Loans\n– Coupon Bearing Bonds\nB] Non-Government Debt\nInstruments issued by Government Agencies and other Statutory Bodies\nGovernment Guaranteed Bonds\nPSU Bonds\nInstruments issued by Public Sector Undertakings\nCommercial Paper\nPSU Bonds\nFixed Coupon Bonds\nFloating Rate Bonds\nZero Coupon Bonds\nInstruments issued by Banks and Development Financial Institutions\nCertificates of Deposit\nPromissory Notes\nBonds\nFixed Coupon Bonds\nFloating Rate Bonds\nZero Coupon Bonds\nInstruments issued by Corporate Bodies\nCommercial Paper\nNon-Convertible Debentures\nFixed Coupon Debentures\nFloating Rate Debentures\nZero Coupon Debentures\nPass Through Securities\nActivity in the Primary and Secondary Market is dominated by Central Government Securities including\nTreasury Bills. These instruments comprise close to 60% of all outstanding debt and more than 75% of the\ndaily trading volume on the Wholesale Debt Market Segment of the National Stock Exchange of India Limited.\nIn the money market, activity levels of the Government and Non- Government Debt vary from time to time.\nInstruments that comprise a major portion of money market activity include,\nOvernight Call\nRepo/Reverse Repo Agreements\nTri-party Repos on Government securities or treasury bills (TREPS)\nTreasury Bills\nGovernment Securities with a residual maturity of < 1 year\nCommercial Paper\n48\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\nCertificates of Deposit\nBills Rediscounting Scheme\nThough not strictly classified as Money Market Instruments, PSU/ DFI / Corporate paper with a residual\nmaturity of < 1 year, are actively traded and offer a viable investment option.\nThe following table gives approximate yields prevailing during the month ended March 31, 2025 on some of\nthe instruments. These yields are indicative and do not indicate yields that may be obtained in future as\ninterest rates keep changing consequent to changes in macro economic conditions and RBI policy.\nInstrument Yield Range\n(% per annum)\nInter bank Call Money 5.75 -6.40\n91 Day Treasury Bill 6.34 -6.56\n364 Day Treasury Bill 6.44 -6.56\nA1 + Commercial Paper 90 Days 7.38 -7.65\n5 Year Government of India Security 6.45 -6.66\n10 Year Government of India Security 6.58 -6.75\n15 Year Government of India Security 6.692 - 6.924\n1 Year Corporate Bond - AAA Rated 7.63 -7.80\n3 Year Corporate Bond - AAA Rated 7.34 -7.48\n5 Year Corporate Bond - AAA Rated 7.33 -7.45\nSource: Bloomberg\nThese yields are indicative and do not indicate yields that may be obtained in future as interest rates keep\nchanging consequent to changes in macro economic conditions and RBI policy. The price and yield on various\ndebt instruments fluctuate from time to time depending upon the macro economic situation, inflation rate,\noverall liquidity position, foreign exchange scenario etc. Also, the price and yield vary according to maturity\nprofile, credit risk etc.\nGenerally, for instruments issued by a non-Government entity (corporate / PSU bonds), the yield is higher\nthan the yield on a Government Security with corresponding maturity. The difference, known as credit spread,\ndepends on the credit rating of the entity.\n• Overseas Debt Market\nThe nature and number of debt instruments available in international debt markets is very wide. In terms of\ndiverse instruments as well as liquidity, overseas debt markets offer great depth and are extremely well\ndeveloped.\nInvestment in international debt greatly expands the universe of top quality debt, which is no longer restricted\nto the limited papers available in the domestic debt market.

Investments in rated international debt offer multiple\nbenefits of risk reduction, a much wider universe of top quality debt and also potential gains from currency\nmovements.\n49\nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID\nInvestments in international markets are most often in U.S. dollars, though the Euro, Pound Sterling and the\nYen are also major currencies. Though this market is geographically well spread across global financial\ncentres, the markets in the U.S., European Union and London offer the most liquidity and depth of\ninstruments.\nBesides factors specific to the country / issuer, international bond prices are influenced to a large extent by\na number of other factors; chief among these are the international economic outlook, changes in interest\nrates in major economies, trading volumes in overseas markets, cross currency movements among major\ncurrencies, rating changes of countries / corporations and major political changes globally.\nThe approximate yields to maturity in the US Bond Market are as follows:\nMaturity US Treasury yields (%)\n(As at March 31, 2025)\n3 months 4.32\n6 months 4.23\n2 years 3.89\n3 years 3.89\n5 years 3.96\n10 years 4.23\nSource : H.15, Federal Reserve Statistical Release\nMaturity US AA\nCorporate Bond yields rate* (%)\n(As at March 31, 2025)\n1 year 4.2684\n2 years 4.1517\n5 years 4.3893\n10 years 4.8634\n(Source - Bloomberg)\n* Composite curve include AA-, AA, AA+ as US AAA curve has been discontinued.\nB.

In case the portfolio of the scheme is not\nrebalanced within the aforementioned mandated plus extended timelines, the AMC shall follow the\nrequirements specified under the aforesaid circular including reporting the deviation to Trustees at each\nstage.\nB. WHERE WILL THE SCHEME INVEST?\nThe Scheme will invest in securities as mentioned below. The investments will be made as per the limits\nspecified in the asset allocation table of the Scheme, subject to permissible limits laid under SEBI (MF)\nRegulations or any other applicable laws and guidelines.\n• Equity and equity related instruments\n• Debt and Money Market Instruments\n• Short Term deposits\n• Units of mutual funds\n• REITs and InvITs\n• Derivatives\n• Investment in overseas securities shall be made in accordance with the requirements stipulated by SEBI\nand RBI from time to time.\nAny other instruments as may be permitted by RBI / SEBI from time to time, subject to necessary\nregulatory approvals.\n13\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\nFor detailed disclosures, kindly refer Section II.\nC. WHAT ARE THE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES?\nThe investment objective of the Scheme is to generate capital appreciation / income from a portfolio,\npredominantly of equity & equity related instruments.\nThe Scheme would predominantly invest in companies spanning entire market capitalization that:\na) are likely to achieve above average growth\nb) enjoy distinct competitive advantages, and\nc) have superior financial strength.\nThe aim of the equity strategy will be to build a portfolio, representing a cross section of companies diversified\nacross major industries, economic sectors and market capitalization that offer an acceptable risk reward\nbalance.\nA part of the funds may be invested in debt and money market instruments. Investment in Debt securities\n(including securitised debt) and Money Market Instruments will be as per the limits in the asset allocation\ntable of the Scheme, subject to permissible limits laid under SEBI (MF) Regulations. Investment in debt\nsecurities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their outlook.\nThe Scheme may also invest in the hybrid securities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for diversification and\nsubject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time.\nSubject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may engage in Stock Lending activities.\nThe Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF)\nRegulations.\nAs part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as futures and\noptions, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible in future under\napplicable regulations. However, trading in derivatives by the Scheme shall be for restricted purposes as\npermitted by the regulations.\nFor detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI. For exposure limits to derivatives, refer section ‘Where\nwill the scheme invest’ under Section II, Part II, Clause A\nThough every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the\nAMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved.\nNo guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme.\nRisk Control\nInvestments made by the Scheme would be in accordance with the investment objectives of the scheme and\nprovisions of SEBI (MF) Regulations. Since investing requires disciplined risk management, the AMC would\nincorporate adequate safeguards for controlling risks in the portfolio construction process. The risk control\nprocess involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes that this\ndiversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use\nvarious derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time,\nwith an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest. While these measures\n14\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\nare expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would\nbe completely eliminated.\nPORTFOLIO TURNOVER\nThe Scheme is an open-ended Scheme. The portfolio is managed from a long term perspective with an\nendeavour to keep portfolio turnover ratio low. However, it is expected that there would be a number of\nsubscriptions and redemptions on a daily basis. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable\nmeasure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage\nand transaction cost.\nD. HOW WILL THE SCHEME BENCHMARK ITS PERFORMANCE?\nNIFTY 500 Index (TRI)\nAs required under clause 1.9 of Master Circular, the benchmark has been selected from amongst those\nnotified by AMFI as the first tier benchmark to be adopted by mutual funds and which are reflective of the\ncategory of the scheme.\nThe NIFTY 500 index represents top 500 companies selected based on full market capitalization from the\neligible universe. The performance will be benchmarked to the Total Returns Variant of the Index.\nThe Trustee reserves the right to change the benchmark for evaluation of performance of the Scheme from\ntime to time in conformity with the investment objectives and appropriateness of the benchmark subject to\nSEBI (MF) Regulations, and other prevailing guidelines, if any.\nE.

Units will be allotted upto 3 decimals.\nIllustration for Computation of NAV:\nNAV for the Scheme shall be calculated as shown below:\nParticulars Amount (In INR)\nAssets\nInvestments (at Market Value) 10,000\n(Equity/Debt/Derivatives)\nCurrent Assets\n20\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\nInterest receivable 1,000\nDividend Receivables 550\nTrades Receivables 1,500\nTotal Assets (A) 13,050\nCurrent Liabilities\nTrade Payables 1,500\nExpense Payable 25\nDividend payable 25\nTotal Liabilities (B) 1,550\nNet Assets (C) (A – B) 11,500\nUnits Outstanding (D) 1,000\nNAV per unit (C/D) ₹ 11.50\nMETHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATION OF SALE AND REPURCHASE PRICE\n• Ongoing Price for subscription (purchase)/ switch-in (from other schemes/ plans of the mutual fund)\nby investors. (This is the price you need to pay for purchase/ switch-in):\nThe Sale Price for a valid purchase will be the Applicable NAV.\ni.e. Sale Price = Applicable NAV\nFor a valid purchase request of Rs. 10,000 where the applicable NAV is Rs. 11.1234, the units allotted will\nbe:\n= 10,000 (i.e. purchase amount)\n11.1234 (i.e. applicable NAV)\n= 899.006 units (rounded to three decimals)\nCharges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above\nillustration.\n• Ongoing Price for redemption (sale)/ switch-outs (to other schemes/plans of the mutual fund) by\ninvestors. (This is the price you will receive for redemptions/ switch-outs):\nThe Repurchase Price for a valid repurchase will be the applicable NAV reduced by any exit load (say 1%).\ni.e. applicable NAV - (applicable NAV X applicable exit load).\nFor a valid repurchase request where the applicable NAV is Rs. 12.1234, the repurchase price will be:\n= 12.1234 - (12.1234 X 1.00%)\n= 12.1234 - 0.1212\n= Rs. 12.0022\nTherefore, for a repurchase of 899.006 units, the proceeds received by the investor will be -\n= 899.006 (units) * 12.0022 (Repurchase price)\n21\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\n= Rs. 10,790.02 (rounded to two decimals)\nCharges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above\nillustration.\nWhile determining the price of the units, the mutual fund shall ensure that the repurchase price of an open\nended scheme is not lower than 95 per cent of the Net Asset Value.\nFor other details such as policies with respect to computation of NAV, rounding off, investment in foreign\nsecurities, procedure in case of delay in disclosure of NAV etc. refer to SAI.\nB.

DEFINITIONS / INTERPRETATION\nVisit: https://www.hdfcfund.com/statutory-disclosure/offer-document-disclosures\nB. RISK FACTORS\n■ Scheme Specific Risk Factors:\nSome of the specific risk factors related to the Scheme include, but are not limited to the following:\n(i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments\n● Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis.\nInvestments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and investors should\nnot invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks.\n● Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger\namount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment in such\nsecurities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk.\n● While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these\ninvestments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme\nincurring losses till the security is finally sold.\n● Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in the\ndebt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances.\n(ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities\n• The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market\ninstruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme\nis expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase\nin the level of interest rates.\n• Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may\nrestrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security\nis finally sold.\n• Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of\nthe issuers.\n• Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of\nan issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which\nmay have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in\neconomic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions\nspecific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit\nquality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will\nendeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis.\n• Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities\nbefore their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such prepayment\nmay force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields,\nresulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n• Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the\nsecurities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on\n27\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\ninterest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be\nlower than that originally assumed.\n• Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and\nsuch periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems\nin settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are\nuninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities\npurchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment\nopportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the\nabsence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in\npotential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in\nthe Scheme's portfolio.\n• Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed income\nsecurity. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest\nrates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing\ncoupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of\ninterest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels\nat which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government\nSecurities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the\nsense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by\nmovement in interest rates in the financial system.\n• Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme\nInformation Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may\nincrease or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level\nof risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are\ncomparatively less risky than AA rated bonds.\n• The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated\nsecurities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may\nincrease the absolute level of risk of the portfolio.\n• As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these\nsecurities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk.\nTherefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in\nzero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero\ncoupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic\npayment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current\ninterest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount\ndepends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest.\nIt also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived\ncredit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than\nthe market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.\n• Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: Except for any security of an associate\nor group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a stock exchange\n(“unlisted Securities”) which in general are subject to greater price fluctuations, less liquidity and\ngreater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid\nsecondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in\nunlisted securities at a fair value.\n• Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than\nrated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer-specific developments. Such investments\ndisplay increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic\nenvironment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities\ntend to be less liquid than rated debt securities.\n28\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\n(iii) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE) rated\nsecurities\nThe risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition to the\nrisk factors associated with debt instruments.\n• Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement\nfor the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in various forms and\ncould include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter of comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity\ncould be either related or non-related to the issuer like a bank, financial institution, etc. Credit\nenhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges,\netc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by\nhypothecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables\netc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluation of the credit enhancement provider, as well as the\nissuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan\npools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer.\n• Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit\nenhancements. Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit\nenhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the liquidity in the\nmarket for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt instruments. Hence,\nlower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments\nand generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold.\n• Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength\nof the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could\nhave an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to\ninability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the\nunderlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk\nof servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore,\napart from issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit\nrisk.\n(iv) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo\nThe mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing\nCorporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri-party\nRepo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL;\nThus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments.\nThe members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the\ndefault fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in\ncase of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL).\nAs per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default\nfund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL's\ncontribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non-\ndefaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution\nbeing invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In addition, the fund contribution is\nallowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting\nmember).\nCCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to\nmeet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and the other for\nmeeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades. The mutual fund is\nexposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of\n29\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\nthe mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by CCIL, as a result\nthe scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund.\n(v) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities\n● Currency Risk:\nMoving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets\nof the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the Indian Rupee\nequivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value\nof certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee.\n● Interest Rate Risk:\nThe pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related, can differ\nsignificantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed to\ntheir interest rate cycles.\n● Credit Risk:\nInvestment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and\nprincipal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is\nsubstantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in debt instruments with\nrating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency.\n● Taxation Risk:\nIn addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information (SAI)\nunder section “Special Consideration”, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges\nbased on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher\nlevel of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation.\nThe Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its\ninvestment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing /\nevolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All these may entail a\nhigher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting its\nNAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor.\n● Legal and Regulatory Risk:\nLegal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it.\nIf any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should\nbe enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject could differ\nmaterially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the\ninvestors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively.\n● Country Risk:\nThe Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk\nencompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect\nforeign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction\nof extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of\nthe overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of\ntrades or otherwise.\n● To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use\nderivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may\nbe stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time.\n• Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities:\n30\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\nIn case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by regulatory\nbodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in permissible Overseas\nSecurities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity.\n(vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives\n● The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an attempt\nto protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products are specialized\ninstruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those associated with\nstocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument\nbut of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability\nof derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices.\n● Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as\ndisproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund\nmanager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the\nfund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No\nassurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies.\n● The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks\nassociated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.\n● Credit Risk:\nThe credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and\nis generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction.\n● Market Risk:\nMarket movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives.\n● Illiquidity risk:\nThis is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of\nliquidity in the market.\nAdditional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate Futures\n(IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used\nto hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the\ngain from the hedge position entered using the IRF.\n(vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares\n● Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of\nDividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non-cumulative preference\nshares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on preference shares in case of inadequate profits\nin any year.\n● Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we\nmay be forced to hold the instrument till maturity.\n● Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured and\nunsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus, there is significant risk of capital\nerosion in case the company goes into liquidation.\n(viii)Risk pertaining to covered call strategy\nIncorrectly pricing the option premium before writing the covered call by ignoring factors which determine\npricing like number of days to expiry, adjustment with respect to announced corporate actions like\ndividend etc.\n31\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\n(ix) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending\nAs with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the\nrisk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the\nagreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary.\nSuch failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities,\nthe inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible\nloss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved\nintermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity\n& loss of opportunity.\n(x) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt\nThe Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent\nthat the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive.\n● Limited Liquidity & Price Risk\nThere is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the\nability of the investor to resell them.\n● Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk\nThe Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates\nrepresent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation\nof either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and\nOriginator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors'\nRepresentative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the\nCredit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the\namount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent\ndefault of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However,\nmany factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required\nto realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may\nbe lower than the amount due from that Obligor.\n● Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs\nIn the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge\nOffs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs).\n● Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility\nIf the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor could\nexperience losses or delays in the payments.\n● Risk of Co-mingling\nWith respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the\nCollection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing\nthe same into the Collection account especially considering that some of the collections may be in the\nform of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from\nother funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors,\nthe Investors may be exposed to a potential loss.\n(xi) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI)\nPerpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile.\nSome of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital\nRegulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory guidelines for\n32\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\nissuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds as per guidelines issued by RBI. The\ninstruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated\nwith these instruments are highlighted below:\nKey Risk Factors:\n- Risk on coupon servicing\nBanks\nAs per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/\npayment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses\nor inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow banks to make payment of\ncoupons.\nNBFCs\nWhile NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can also be\ndeferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios.\nCorporates\nCorporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually\ncumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI.\n- Risk of write-down or conversion into equity\nBanks\nAs per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET-\n1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written down. Further,\nAT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in\nthe event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank\nis deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds\nor a public sector capital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector\ninjection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates.\n- Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer\nBanks\nThe issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period from the\ndate of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does not exercise the\ncall on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call\nexercise date.\nNBFCs\nThe NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per the\nregulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines.\nHowever, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have to hold the instruments\nfor a period beyond the first call exercise date.\nCorporates\nThere is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the call option,\nthe Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise date.\n33\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\n(xii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling\nShort-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he\nborrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and\nreturns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock\nback for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price\nand the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short\npositions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price\nincreases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio.\n(xiii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:\n● Price Risk:\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis\nowing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market\nconditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of\ninterest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures.\n● Interest Rate Risk:\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise,\nprices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n● Credit Risk:\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or\neven on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are\nlikely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled.\n● Liquidity Risk:\nThis refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no\nassurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time\nwhen trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a\ndiscount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments for which a liquid market exists. As\nthese products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk.\n● Reinvestment Risk:\nInvestments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be\nrepatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay-outs, etc. Consequently,\nthe proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns.\n● Legal and Regulatory Risk\nThe regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs comprises\na relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators\nand courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new laws, regulations\nor standards or future amendments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole.\nFurthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way that will\nimpair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively\nor make distributions.\n(xiv) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes\n1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any\nchange in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the\nperformance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes.\n34\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\n2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads.\n(xv) General Risk factors\n• Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments\nmade by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods\nand such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt\nof proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down because of\nvarious factors that affect the capital markets in general.\n• As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes\nand settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be significant in\nthe event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view\nof the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending\nredemptions) under certain circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption\nand / or Suspend Redemption of the units.\n• At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest\nin securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash\nor cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to\nsubstantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments\nin cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity requirements.\n• Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the\nportfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to medium term period.\n• Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may\ninclude changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies.\n• The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset-liability\nmismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities\nleading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments.\nC. RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES\nRisk Mitigation measures for investments in equity / equity related and debt instruments\n• The Scheme aims to maintain a well-diversified equity portfolio comprising stocks across various sectors\nof the economy. This shall aid in managing concentration risk and sector specific risks.\n• The Scheme targets to maintain exposure across different market cap segments - i.e. large, mid-cap and\nsmall cap. This shall aid in managing volatility and also improve liquidity.\n• Any investments in debt securities would be undertaken after assessing the associated credit risk,\ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk.\nCredit Evaluation Policy\nThe credit evaluation policy of the AMC entails evaluation of credit fundamentals of each investment\nopportunity. Some of the factors that are evaluated inter-alia may include outlook on the sector, parentage,\nquality of management, and overall financial strength of the credit. The AMC utilises ratings of recognized\nrating agencies as an input in the credit evaluation process. Investments in bonds and debenture are usually\nin instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by a recognized rating agency.\nIn line with clause 12.12 of Master Circular, the AMC may constitute committee(s) to approve proposals for\ninvestments in unrated instruments. The AMC Board and the Trustee shall approve the detailed parameters\nfor such investments. The details of such investments would be communicated by the AMC to the Trustee in\ntheir periodical reports. It would also be clearly mentioned in the reports, how the parameters have been\ncomplied with. However, in case any security does not fall under the parameters, the prior approval of Board\nof AMC and Trustee shall be sought.\n35\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\nLiquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to sell / liquidate a security at short notice at\nprevailing market prices or without incurring impact cost. While government bonds, money market\ninstruments and shorter maturity instruments are generally easier to sell, corporate bonds and other\ninstruments typically face higher liquidity risk. Further, higher rated securities normally are more liquid\ncompared to lower rated securities. As a result, different portfolios will face different levels of liquidity risk\nbased on the underlying portfolio composition. Some of the strategies to reduce liquidity risk are creating\nportfolios that are diversified across maturities, ratings, types of securities, etc. in line with the fund\nobjectives, regulations and investment strategy.\nCredit Risk: Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities. Hence,\ncredit risk faced by different schemes will be different based on the underlying portfolio / investment\nstrategy. To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be\nundertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors\n(parentage, track record etc.). Each of the scheme/portfolio will endeavour to maintain adequate\ndiversification across issuers / sectors in line with scheme objectives, regulations and investment\nstrategy. Unrated investments, if any, would require specific approval from a committee constituted for\nthe purpose.\nDebt Derivatives Risk: The AMC has provision for using derivative instruments for portfolio balancing\nand hedging purposes. Interest Rate Swaps will be done with approved counter parties under pre\napproved ISDA agreements. Mark to Market of swaps, netting off of cash flow and default provision\nclauses will be provided as per standard practice on a reciprocal basis. Interest Rate Swaps and other\nderivative instruments will be used as per local (RBI and SEBI) regulatory guidelines.\nInterest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk of change in the NAVs due to change in overall market\nyields. The change in value of a security, for a given change in yield, is higher for a security with higher\nduration and vice versa. Hence portfolios with higher duration will have higher volatility. The AMC shall\nstrive to actively manage the duration of the respective funds based on the prevailing market conditions\n/ outlook of interest rates, keeping in mind the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable\nregulations.\nConcentration Risk: The AMC will attempt to mitigate this risk by maintaining adequate diversification\nacross issuers/ sectors / instrument type in line with the scheme objectives, investment strategy and\napplicable regulations. This will also be managed by keeping prudent investment limits on any particular\nindustry or issuer or issuer group based on the size, credit profile, etc. to reduce issuer or industry specific\nrisk.\nRisk Mitigation measures for investments in Non-Convertible Preference Shares:\nCredit Risk - To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer\nwill be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative\nfactors (parentage, track record etc.).\nLiquidity Risk - The Fund endeavours to invest in preference shares of those companies which have\nrelatively better market acceptability amongst market participants that increases the probability of\nsecondary sale in case an exit from the investment is required.\nUnsecured in nature - The Fund endeavours to mitigate this risk by exercising due diligence while\nassessing the business, financial and management risks of the company before investing.\nRisk Mitigation factors relating to investment in Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI):\n• Risk on coupon servicing and Risk of write-down or conversion into equity\n36\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\nBanks: The risks on coupon servicing or principal write down/ conversion to equity are mitigated, to a certain\nextent, if the investee bank has strong financial position and meets the required regulatory guidelines. Hence,\nan in-depth credit evaluation of each bank is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage,\nprofitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.).\nGiven the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable\nsurplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed.\nInvestment is done only in the AT-1 bonds of banks with strong credit worthiness, in our assessment. This,\nin turn, reduces the risk of its capital position falling below regulatory requirements and / or reaching PONV.\nRisk of write-down or conversion into equity is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates.\n• Risk on coupon servicing\nNBFCs\nThese risks are mitigated, to certain extent, if the investee NBFC has strong financial position and meets the\nrequired regulatory guidelines. Hence, an in-depth credit evaluation of each NBFC is undertaken, keeping in\nmind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors\n(parentage, track record etc.). Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track\nrecord of profitability, distributable surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to\ninfuse capital, in case it is needed.\nCorporates\nTo mitigate this risk, an in-depth credit evaluation of each corporate is undertaken, keeping in mind both\nquantitative (leverage, profitability, industry position, market share etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage,\ntrack record etc.). Additionally, given that the coupon is usually cumulative in nature and the corporate is\nrestricted from paying any dividends till all previous dues are paid to the perpetual bond investor, the company\nhas adequate incentive to not defer coupon on PDIs.\n• Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer\nBanks\nWhile the issuer bank does have an option to not exercise the first call, experience suggests that all Indian\nbanks till now have exercised the call option during the call period. We believe that banks are cognizant of\nthe investor sensitivities with regards to risk of not exercising the call option at the first call date. Further, as\nwe invest in issuers with sound credit worthiness, we expect them to understand the importance of exercising\nthe call as the part of their long term capital raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of call option exercise\ncan lead to increase in cost of AT1 bonds for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond\ntenors) and impact the bank's profitability adversely. Given the importance of AT1 instruments for prudently\nmanaging the capital levels and improving the returns for the equity holders, we are of the opinion that banks\nwould choose to service the interest on AT1 bonds and exercise the first call option on AT1 bonds, as they\nhave done in the past. Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual instrument on first call date\n(say due to market disruption), the annual call on these instruments would enable the bank to call the bond\non any of the subsequent annual call options dates.\nNBFCs and Corporates\nWhile the issuer is not obligated to exercise the call option on first call date, the coupon step-up usually\nprovides financial incentive to the Issuer to exercise the call option. Further, as we invest in issuer with sound\ncredit worthiness, we expect them to be cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to exercising the\ncall as the part of their long term resource raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of first call option exercise\ncan lead to increase in cost of PDI for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond tenors)\nand impact the issuer's profitability adversely. Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual\ninstrument on first call date (say due to market disruption), the coupon step up also compensates the investor\nfor extended holding period.\n37\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\nWhile these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance\nthat these risks would be completely eliminated.\nII. INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCHEME:\nA. WHERE WILL THE SCHEME INVEST?\nThe Scheme will invest in securities as mentioned below.

The appointment of such intermediaries shall be in\naccordance with the applicable requirements of SEBI and within the permissible ceilings of expenses as\nstated under Regulation 52 of SEBI (MF) Regulations.\n• Investment in Securitised Debt\n40\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\nA securitisation transaction involves sale of receivables by the originator (a bank, non-banking finance\ncompany, housing finance company, or a manufacturing/service company) to a Special Purpose Vehicle\n(SPV), typically set up in the form of a trust. Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs),\nthe proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator. In this manner, the originator, by selling\nhis loan receivables to an SPV, receives consideration from investors much before the maturity of the\nunderlying loans. Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying loans from borrowers. Typically,\nthe transaction is provided with a limited amount of credit enhancement (as stipulated by the rating agency\nfor a target rating), which provides protection to investors against defaults by the underlying borrowers.\nGenerally available asset classes for securitisation in India are:\n● Commercial vehicles\n● Auto and two wheeler pools\n● Mortgage pools (residential housing loans)\n● Personal loan, credit card and other retail loans\n● Corporate loans/receivables\nInvestment / Risk Mitigation Strategy\n1. Risk profile of securitised debt vis-à-vis risk appetite of the Scheme\nThe risk profile of securitised debt is generally at par with the risk profile of other debt securities at the\nsame level of credit rating. Securitised debt offers additional income (spread) over a debt security of\nsimilar rating and maturity, which enables the scheme to optimize its income without taking any additional\ncredit risk. Securitised debt is generally less liquid, however, investment in securitised debt is made to\nmaintain a diversified portfolio of debt securities that optimizes return without increasing the overall risk\nprofile of the Scheme.\n2. Policy relating to originators based on nature of originator, track record, NPAs, losses in earlier\nsecuritised debt, etc\nThe originator is an entity (like banks, non-banking finance companies, corporates etc), which has initially\nprovided the loan & is also generally responsible for servicing the loans. The schemes will invest in\nsecuritised debt of originators with at least investment grade credit rating and established track record. A\ndetailed evaluation of originator is done before the investment is made in securitised debt of any originator\non various parameters given below:\n● Track record\nThe investment in securitised debt is done based on origination and underwriting process and\ncapabilities of the originator, overview of corporate structure, group to which they belong, experience\nof the company in the business & how long they have been in the business, financial condition of the\ncompany, credit rating, past performance of similar pools by the originator, etc.\n● Willingness to pay through credit enhancement facilities etc.\nCredit enhancement is provided by the originator, as indicated by rating agencies, so as to adequately\ncover the defaults and acts as a risk mitigation measure. The size of the credit enhancement as\nindicated by rating agency depends on the originator's track record, past delinquencies, pattern of the\nportfolio & characteristics of the pool vis-a-vis of the portfolio, nature of the asset class.\n● Ability to pay\nThe quality of the origination impacts the performance of the underlying asset & thus originators with\nstrong systems and processes in place can eliminate poor quality assets. A robust risk management\nsystem of the originator and availability of MIS reports on timely basis, results in creation of strong\nasset portfolio.\n● Business Risk Assessment\nThe business risk assessment of originator / underlying borrower also includes detailed credit\nassessment wherein following factors are also considered:\n41\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\n- Outlook for the economy (domestic and global)\n- Outlook for the industry\n- Company specific factors\nIn addition, a detailed review and assessment of rating rationale is done along with interactions with\nthe company as well as the rating agency. All investment in securitised debt is done after taking into\naccount, the Critical Evaluation Parameters (for pool loan and single loan securitisation transactions)\nregarding the originator / underlying issuer as mentioned below:\n● Default track record/ frequent alteration of redemption conditions / covenants\n● High leverage ratios of the ultimate borrower (for single-sell downs) - both on a standalone basis\nas well on a consolidated level/ group level\n● Higher proportion of reschedulement of underlying assets of the pool or loan, as the case may be\n● Higher proportion of overdue assets of the pool or the underlying loan, as the case may be\n● Poor reputation in market\n● Insufficient track record of servicing of the pool or the loan, as the case may be.\n3. Risk mitigation strategies for investments with each kind of originator\nInvestments are based on assessment of following parameters, so as to mitigate risk associated with\nsuch investment:\na. Credit quality, size and reach of the originator\nb. Nature of receivables/asset category i.e. cars, construction equipment, commercial vehicles, personal\nloans etc.\nc. Collection process, infrastructure and follow-up mechanism\nd. Quality of MIS\ne. Credit cum liquidity enhancement\nf. Credit appraisal norms of originator\ng. Asset Quality - portfolio delinquency levels\nh. Past performance of rated pools\ni. Pool Characteristics - seasoning, Loan-to-value ratios, geographic diversity etc.\n4. The level of diversification with respect to the underlying assets, and risk mitigation measures for\nless diversified investments\nDiversification of underlying assets is achieved through a) prudent mix of asset categories - i.e. cars (new,\nused), commercial vehicles, construction equipment, unsecured loans to individuals or small & medium\nenterprises b) total number of contracts in a pool c) average ticket size of loans and d) geographical\ndistribution.\nRisk mitigation measures for less diversified investments in pools is accomplished through the size of\ncredit enhancement, seasoning or loan to value ratios.\nIllustrative framework, which will be applied while evaluating investment decision relating to a pool\nsecuritisation transaction:\nCharacteristics/ Mortgage Commercial Car 2 Micro Personal Single Others\nType of Pool Loan Vehicle and wheelers Finance Loans Sell\nConstruction Pools Downs\nEquipment\nApproximate\n12-60 8-40 Refer Refer\nAverage maturity (in NA 12-60 months NA NA\nmonths months Note A Note B\nMonths)\n42\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\nCollateral margin\n(including cash,\nguarantees, excess NA 5-20% 4-15% 4-15% NA NA\ninterest spread,\nsubordinate tranche)\nAverage Loan to\nNA 80-95% 70-90% 70-95% NA NA\nValue Ratio\nAverage seasoning 3-8 2-5\nNA 3-8 months NA NA\nof the Pool months months\nMaximum single NA NA\nexposure range NA 3-7% (Retail (Retail NA NA\npool) Pool)\nAverage single\nNA 1-5% 0-1% 0-1% NA NA\nexposure range %\nNA - Not Applicable\nInformation in the table above is based on current scenario and is subject to change depending upon the\nchange in related factors.\nNotes:\nA. In case of securitised debt with underlying being single loan, the investment limit applicable to the\nunderlying borrower is considered.\nB. Other investment will be decided on a case to case basis.\nIn case of asset backed pools (ABS), evaluation of the pool assets is done considering the following\nfactors: (Refer the table above which illustrates the averages of parameters considered while selecting\nthe pool)\n• Size of the loan\n• Average original maturity of the pool\n• Loan to Value Ratio\n• Average seasoning of the pool\n• Default rate distribution\n• Geographical Distribution\n• Credit enhancement facility\n• Liquid facility\n• Structure of the pool\n5. Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation\nThe illustrative average seasoning of the debt by originator prior to securitisation is given above in table\n(Refer Point 4).\nMinimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation in the case of asset pools is in\nthe form of seasoning of loans to various asset classes (cars, commercial vehicles, etc.) and generally\nvaries from one month to six months depending on the nature of asset.\n6. Minimum retention percentage by originator of debts to be securitised\n43\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\nWhile minimum retention percentage by originator is not prescribed, any amount retained by the originator\nthrough subordination is viewed positively at the time of making investment and generally varies from 5%\nto 10%.\n7. The mechanism to tackle conflict of interest when the mutual fund invests in securitised debt of\nan originator and the originator in turn makes investments in that particular scheme of the fund\nAll proposals for investment in securitised debt are evaluated by the credit analyst based on several\nparameters such as nature of underlying asset category, pool characteristics, asset quality, credit rating\nof the securitisation transaction, and credit cum liquidity enhancement available. Investment in securitised\ndebt in any scheme is made by the respective fund manager in line with the investment objective of that\nscheme.\n8. The resources and mechanism of individual risk assessment with the AMC for monitoring\ninvestment in securitised debt (in general)\nInvestment in securitised debt is monitored regularly with regards to its performance on various\nparameters such as collection efficiency, delinquencies, prepayments and utilization of credit\nenhancement. Information on these parameters is available through monthly reports from Pool Trustees\nand through information disseminated by the rating agencies. Monthly performance report is released by\nthe credit analyst to the fund management team and the fund management team periodically reviews the\nsame.\nTrading in Derivatives\n• The Scheme may take derivatives position based on the opportunities available subject to the guidelines\nprovided by SEBI from time to time and in line with the overall investment objective of the Scheme.\n• The Scheme intends to use derivatives mainly for the purpose of hedging and portfolio balancing. Losses\nmay arise as a result of using derivatives, but these are likely to be compensated by the gains on the\nunderlying cash instruments held by the Scheme.\n• The Scheme may take position in derivative instruments like Futures, Options, and such other derivative\ninstruments as may be permitted by SEBI from time to time.\nExposure to Derivatives\nThe exposure limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by SEBI vide its clause 12.25 of\nMaster Circular and as amended from time to time are as follows:\nPosition Limits\nThe position limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by clause 12.25 of Master circular\nread with SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-2/P/CIR/2024/140 dated October 15, 2024 as\namended from time to time are as follows:\ni.

Cash or cash equivalents i.e. Government Securities, T-Bills and Repo on Government Securities\nhaving residual maturity of less than 91 days may be treated as not creating any exposure.\n5. Exposure due to hedging positions may not be included in the above mentioned limits subject to\nthe following:\na) Hedging positions are the derivative positions that reduce possible losses on an existing\nposition in securities and till the existing position remains.\nb) Hedging positions cannot be taken for existing derivative positions. Exposure due to such\npositions shall have to be added and treated under limits mentioned in Point 1.\nc) Any derivative instrument used to hedge has the same underlying security as the existing\nposition being hedged.\nd) The quantity of underlying associated with the derivative position taken for hedging\npurposes does not exceed the quantity of the existing position against which hedge has\nbeen taken.\n6. (a) Mutual Funds may enter into plain vanilla Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) for hedging purposes.

However, if mutual funds are\ntransacting in IRS through an electronic trading platform offered by the Clearing Corporation of\nIndia Ltd. (CCIL) and CCIL is the central counterparty for such transactions guaranteeing\nsettlement, the single counterparty limit of 10% shall not be applicable.\n7. Exposure due to derivative positions taken for hedging purposes in excess of the underlying\nposition against which the hedging position has been taken, shall be treated under the limits\nmentioned in point 1.\n8. Definition of Exposure in case of Derivative Positions\nEach position taken in derivatives shall have an associated exposure as defined under.

The\nunencumbered shares in a scheme shall mean shares that are not part of Securities Lending and\nBorrowing Mechanism (SLBM), margin or any other kind of encumbrances.\nc) In case the Scheme needs to sell securities on which a call option is written under a covered call\nstrategy, it must ensure compliance with (a) and (b) above while selling the securities.\nd) The Scheme shall not write a call option without holding the underlying equity shares. A call option\ncan be written only on shares which are not hedged using other derivative contracts.\ne) The total gross exposure related to option premium paid and received will not exceed 20% of the net\nassets of the Schemes.\nExposure limits on Credit Default Swaps (CDS)\nExposure through CDS (Notional amount of both CDS bought and sold) shall not exceed 10% of AUM of\nscheme and shall be within the overall limit of derivatives.\nExposure limits on Interest Rate Futures (IRF)\nThe exposure limits for trading in Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) by Mutual Funds specified by clause\n12.25.9 of Master Circular are as follows:\ni. To reduce interest rate risk in a debt portfolio, mutual funds may hedge the portfolio or part of the\nportfolio (including one or more securities) on weighted average modified duration basis by using\nInterest Rate Futures (IRFs). The maximum extent of short position that may be taken in IRFs to hedge\ninterest rate risk of the portfolio or part of the portfolio, is as per the formula given below:\n(Portfolio Modified Duration*\nMarket Value of the Portfolio)\n(Futures Modified Duration *Futures Price/PAR)\nii. In case the IRF used for hedging the interest rate risk has different underlying security(s) than the\nexisting position being hedged, it would result in imperfect hedging.\niii. Imperfect hedging using IRFs may be considered to be exempted from the gross exposure, upto\nmaximum of 20% of the net assets of the scheme, subject to the following:\na) Exposure to IRFs is created only for hedging the interest rate risk based on the weighted average\nmodified duration of the bond portfolio or part of the portfolio.\nb) Mutual Funds are permitted to resort to imperfect hedging, without it being considered under the\ngross exposure limits, if and only if, the correlation between the portfolio or part of the portfolio\n(excluding the hedged portions, if any) and the IRF is atleast 0.9 at the time of initiation of hedge.\nIn case of any subsequent deviation from the correlation criteria, the same may be rebalanced\n47\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\nwithin 5 working days and if not rebalanced within the timeline, the derivative positions created for\nhedging shall be considered under the gross exposure computed in terms of clause 12.24.1 of\nMaster Circular. The correlation should be calculated for a period of last 90 days.\nExplanation: If the fund manager intends to do imperfect hedging upto 15% of the portfolio using\nIRFs on weighted average modified duration basis, either of the following conditions need to be\ncomplied with:\ni. The correlation for past 90 days between the portfolio and the IRF is at least 0.9 or\nii. The correlation for past 90 days between the part of the portfolio (excluding the hedged\nportions, if any) i.e. at least 15% of the net asset of the scheme (including one or more\nsecurities) and the IRF is at least 0.9.\nc) At no point of time, the net modified duration of part of the portfolio being hedged should be\nnegative.\nd) The portion of imperfect hedging in excess of 20% of the net assets of the scheme should be\nconsidered as creating exposure and shall be included in the computation of gross exposure in\nterms of clause 12.24.1 of Master Circular.\n• Debt Market In India\nThe instruments available in Indian Debt Market are classified into two categories, namely Government and\nNon - Government debt. The instruments available in these categories include:\nA] Government Debt\nCentral Government Debt\nTreasury Bills\nDated Government Securities\n– Coupon Bearing Bonds\n– Floating Rate Bonds\n– Zero Coupon Bonds\nState Government Debt\n– State Government Loans\n– Coupon Bearing Bonds\nB] Non-Government Debt\nInstruments issued by Government Agencies and other Statutory Bodies\nGovernment Guaranteed Bonds\nPSU Bonds\nInstruments issued by Public Sector Undertakings\nCommercial Paper\nPSU Bonds\nFixed Coupon Bonds\nFloating Rate Bonds\nZero Coupon Bonds\nInstruments issued by Banks and Development Financial Institutions\nCertificates of Deposit\nPromissory Notes\nBonds\n48\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\nFixed Coupon Bonds\nFloating Rate Bonds\nZero Coupon Bonds\nInstruments issued by Corporate Bodies\nCommercial Paper\nNon-Convertible Debentures\nFixed Coupon Debentures\nFloating Rate Debentures\nZero Coupon Debentures\nPass Through Securities\nActivity in the Primary and Secondary Market is dominated by Central Government Securities including\nTreasury Bills. These instruments comprise close to 60% of all outstanding debt and more than 75% of the\ndaily trading volume on the Wholesale Debt Market Segment of the National Stock Exchange of India Limited.\nIn the money market, activity levels of the Government and Non- Government Debt vary from time to time.\nInstruments that comprise a major portion of money market activity include,\nOvernight Call\nRepo/Reverse Repo Agreements\nTri-party Repos on Government securities or treasury bills (TREPS)\nTreasury Bills\nGovernment Securities with a residual maturity of < 1 year\nCommercial Paper\nCertificates of Deposit\nBills Rediscounting Scheme\nThough not strictly classified as Money Market Instruments, PSU/ DFI / Corporate paper with a residual\nmaturity of < 1 year, are actively traded and offer a viable investment option.\nThe following table gives approximate yields prevailing during the month ended March 31, 2025 on some of\nthe instruments. These yields are indicative and do not indicate yields that may be obtained in future as\ninterest rates keep changing consequent to changes in macro economic conditions and RBI policy.\nInstrument Yield Range\n(% per annum)\nInter bank Call Money 5.75 -6.40\n91 Day Treasury Bill 6.34 -6.56\n364 Day Treasury Bill 6.44 -6.56\nA1 + Commercial Paper 90 Days 7.38 -7.65\n5 Year Government of India Security 6.45 -6.66\n10 Year Government of India Security 6.58 -6.75\n15 Year Government of India Security 6.692 - 6.924\n1 Year Corporate Bond - AAA Rated 7.63 -7.80\n3 Year Corporate Bond - AAA Rated 7.34 -7.48\n49\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\n5 Year Corporate Bond - AAA Rated 7.33 -7.45\nSource: Bloomberg\nThese yields are indicative and do not indicate yields that may be obtained in future as interest rates keep\nchanging consequent to changes in macro economic conditions and RBI policy. The price and yield on various\ndebt instruments fluctuate from time to time depending upon the macro economic situation, inflation rate,\noverall liquidity position, foreign exchange scenario etc. Also, the price and yield vary according to maturity\nprofile, credit risk etc.\nGenerally, for instruments issued by a non-Government entity (corporate / PSU bonds), the yield is higher\nthan the yield on a Government Security with corresponding maturity. The difference, known as credit spread,\ndepends on the credit rating of the entity.\n• Overseas Debt Market\nThe nature and number of debt instruments available in international debt markets is very wide. In terms of\ndiverse instruments as well as liquidity, overseas debt markets offer great depth and are extremely well\ndeveloped.\nInvestment in international debt greatly expands the universe of top quality debt, which is no longer restricted\nto the limited papers available in the domestic debt market. The higher rated overseas sovereign, quasi-\ngovernment and corporate debt offer lower default risk in addition to offering a high degree of liquidity since\nthese are traded across major international markets. Investments in rated international debt offer multiple\nbenefits of risk reduction, a much wider universe of top quality debt and also potential gains from currency\nmovements.\nInvestments in international markets are most often in U.S. dollars, though the Euro, Pound Sterling and the\nYen are also major currencies. Though this market is geographically well spread across global financial\ncentres, the markets in the U.S., European Union and London offer the most liquidity and depth of\ninstruments.\nBesides factors specific to the country / issuer, international bond prices are influenced to a large extent by\na number of other factors; chief among these are the international economic outlook, changes in interest\nrates in major economies, trading volumes in overseas markets, cross currency movements among major\ncurrencies, rating changes of countries / corporations and major political changes globally.\nThe approximate yields to maturity in the US Bond Market are as follows:\nMaturity US Treasury yields (%)\n(As at March 31, 2025)\n3 months 4.32\n6 months 4.23\n2 years 3.89\n3 years 3.89\n5 years 3.96\n10 years 4.23\nSource : H.15, Federal Reserve Statistical Release\n50\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund-SID\nMaturity US AA\nCorporate Bond yields rate* (%)\n(As at March 31, 2025)\n1 year 4.2684\n2 years 4.1517\n5 years 4.3893\n10 years 4.8634\n(Source - Bloomberg)\n* Composite curve include AA-, AA, AA+ as US AAA curve has been discontinued.\nB.

Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk.\n● While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell\nthese investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may\nlead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold.\n● Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments\nheld in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances.\n(ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities\n• The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money\nMarket instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The\nNAV of the Scheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be\nadversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates.\n• Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market,\nwhich may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring\nlosses till the security is finally sold.\n• Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term\nrating of the issuers.\n• Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e.\nthe risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or\nany other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial\nconditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes\nin economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that\nmay have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may\nincrease the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit\nrisk through in-house credit analysis.\n• Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its\nsecurities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of\nsuch prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in\nsecurities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n• Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received\nfrom the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment\nis the \"interest on interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows\ncan be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed.\n• Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement\nperiods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances.\nDelays or other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods\nwhen the assets of the Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The\ninability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems,\ncould cause the Scheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to\nsell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and\nliquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the\nScheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in the\nScheme's portfolio.\n• Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed\nincome security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall\nand when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a\n6\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM\nfunction of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level\nof interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which\ngovernment raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already\ndealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government Securities. It\nexists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the\nsense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced\nonly by movement in interest rates in the financial system.\n• Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the\nScheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the\nScheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g.\ncorporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even\namong corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated\nbonds.\n• The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated /\nunrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer\nattractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio.\n• As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the\nsecurity, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to\nissuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The\nAMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may\nincrease the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations\nthat do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a\nspecified date when the securities begin paying current interest and therefore, are\ngenerally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the\ntime remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It\nalso varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the\nperceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are\ngenerally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.\n• Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: Except for any security of an\nassociate or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a\nstock exchange (“unlisted Securities”) which in general are subject to greater price\nfluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the open market.\nUnlisted debt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no assurance\nthat the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value.\n• Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value\nhigher than rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer-specific developments.\nSuch investments display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a\ndeteriorating economic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to\nbe more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities.\n(iii) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement\n(CE) rated securities\nThe risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in\naddition to the risk factors associated with debt instruments.\n• Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit\nenhancement for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could\nbe in various forms and could include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter of comfort, etc.\n7\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM\nfrom another entity. This entity could be either related or non-related to the issuer like a\nbank, financial institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form\nof pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/\nmortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by hypothecation of car loan\nreceivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for\nCE rated instruments evaluation of the credit enhancement provider, as well as the issuer\nis undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan\npools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer.\n• Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit\nenhancements. Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due\nto the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities,\nthe liquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar\nrated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of\nthe scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher\nimpact cost when such instruments are sold.\n• Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the\ncombined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the\nissuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The\nweakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure\ndue to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce\nguarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases\nthe overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore, apart from\nissuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit\nrisk.\n(iv) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo\nThe mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the\nClearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government\nsecurities and in Tri-party Repo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and\nsettlement systems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks\nconsiderably for transactions in the said segments. The members are required to contribute an\namount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as\na part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any\nmember in settling transactions routed through CCIL).\nAs per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to\nthe default fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post\nutilization of CCIL's contribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default\nfund contributions of the non-defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the\ninitial margin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any\nsettlement obligations. In addition, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the\nresidual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member).\nCCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with\na view to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades\nand the other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo\ntrades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of CCIL,\n8\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM\nin the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default\nlosses of another member by CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to\nits contribution to the default fund.\n(v) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities\n● Currency Risk:\nMoving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that\nthe assets of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the\nIndian Rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected\nby changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee.\n● Interest Rate Risk:\nThe pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related,\ncan differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the\nScheme stand exposed to their interest rate cycles.\n● Credit Risk:\nInvestment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet\ninterest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness\nof the issuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate\ninvestments only in debt instruments with rating not below investment grade by\naccredited/registered credit rating agency.\n● Taxation Risk:\nIn addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional\nInformation (SAI) under section “Special Consideration”, Investment in Foreign Securities\nposes additional challenges based on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction.\nThe scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual\ntaxation.\nThe Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from\nits investment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the\nchanging / evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All\nthese may entail a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc.\nthus adversely impacting its NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor.\n● Legal and Regulatory Risk:\nLegal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely\naffect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or\nregulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors\nmay be subject could differ materially from current requirements and may materially and\nadversely affect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also\nbe imposed retrospectively.\n● Country Risk:\nThe Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the\nrisk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might\nadversely affect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include\nevents such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-\n9\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM\nlateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax\nlaws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of trades or otherwise.\n● To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund\nmay use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance\nwith conditions as may be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time.\n• Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities:\nIn case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by\nregulatory bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in\npermissible Overseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity.\n(vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives\n● The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in\nan attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative\nproducts are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis\ndifferent from those associated with stocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an\nunderstanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks\ninclude, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate\nperfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices.\n● Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well\nas disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the\nability of the fund manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the\nstrategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund\nmanager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will\nbe able to identify or execute such strategies.\n● The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the\nrisks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.\n● Credit Risk:\nThe credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its\nobligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative\ntransaction.\n● Market Risk:\nMarket movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives.\n● Illiquidity risk:\nThis is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due\nto lack of liquidity in the market.\nAdditional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate\nFutures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and\nthe IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the\nportfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF.\n(vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares\n10\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM\n● Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of\npayment of Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non-\ncumulative preference shares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on preference\nshares in case of inadequate profits in any year.\n● Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and\nthus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity.\n● Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than\nsecured and unsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus there is\nsignificant risk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation.\n(viii)Risk pertaining to covered call strategy\nIncorrectly pricing the option premium before writing the covered call by ignoring factors which\ndetermine pricing like number of days to expiry, adjustment with respect to announced\ncorporate actions like dividend etc.\n(ix) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending\nAs with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending,\nincluding the risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply\nwith the terms of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme\nand the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the\ncollateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to\nreturn the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits\naccruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The\nscheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss\nof opportunity.\n(x) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt\nThe Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not\nrepresent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive.\n● Limited Liquidity & Price Risk\nThere is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This\ncould limit the ability of the investor to resell them.\n● Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk\nThe Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These\nCertificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not\nrepresent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any\naffiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate\nHolders against the Investors' Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause\ndepletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor\nPayouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit\nEnhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to\nrepay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However, many factors\nmay affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required to\n11\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM\nrealise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold\nmay be lower than the amount due from that Obligor.\n● Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs\nIn the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also,\nany Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates\n(PTCs).\n● Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility\nIf the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor\ncould experience losses or delays in the payments.\n● Risk of Co-mingling\nWith respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the\nObligors into the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by\na Servicer and depositing the same into the Collection account especially considering that\nsome of the collections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the\nLoan Agreements may not be segregated from other funds of originator. If originator in its\ncapacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to\na potential loss.\n(xi) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI)\nPerpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their\ncapital profile. Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for\nBasel III Capital Regulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are\nno regulatory guidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds\nas per guidelines issued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is\nno fixed maturity date. The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below:\nKey Risk Factors:\n- Risk on coupon servicing\nBanks\nAs per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel\ndistributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable\nreserves and surpluses or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow\nbanks to make payment of coupons.\nNBFCs\nWhile NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can\nalso be deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of\ncapital ratios.\nCorporates\nCorporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon\nis usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon\nrate of the PDI.\n- Risk of write-down or conversion into equity\nBanks\n12\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM\nAs per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity\nTier-1 (CET-1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get\nwritten down. Further, AT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common\nequity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV\nis a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non-viable unless\nthere is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection\nhappens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital.\nThis risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates.\n- Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer\nBanks\nThe issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified\nperiod from the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the\nbank does not exercise the call on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the\ninstruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date.\nNBFCs\nThe NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as\nper the regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the\nRBI guidelines. However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may\nhave to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date.\nCorporates\nThere is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the\ncall option, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call\nexercise date.\n(xii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling\nShort-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade.\nInstead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the\nstock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects,\nShort seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the\ndifference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock\nappreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money\nand these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall\nresult into major losses in the portfolio.\n(xiii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:\n● Price Risk:\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a\ndaily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in\ngeneral market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and\n13\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM\nInfrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer\nprocedures.\n● Interest Rate Risk:\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates\nrise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n● Credit Risk:\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest\npayment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of\nREITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not\nnecessarily be pre scheduled.\n● Liquidity Risk:\nThis refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is\nno assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there\nwould be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of\nilliquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments\nfor which a liquid market exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be\nexposed to liquidity risk.\n● Reinvestment Risk:\nInvestments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there\ncould be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay-outs,\netc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns.\n● Legal and Regulatory Risk\nThe regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs\ncomprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and\nenforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast\nas to how any new laws, regulations or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers\nof REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the\nregulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply\nwith the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions.\n(xiv) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes\n1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance.\nAny change in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will\naffect the performance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes.\n2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads.\n(xv) General Risk factors\n• Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the\ninvestments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have\ndifferent settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen\ncircumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the\nUnits of the Scheme can go up or down because of various factors that affect the capital\nmarkets in general.\n14\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM\n• As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading\nvolumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units\nmay be significant in the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or\nrestructuring of the Scheme. In view of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole\ndiscretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending redemptions) under certain\ncircumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend\nRedemption of the units in the SID.\n• At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be\nable to invest in securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies\ncollected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities /\ninvestments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The\nScheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity\nrequirements.\n• Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance\nbetween the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to\nmedium term period.\n• Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments,\nwhich may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation\npolicies.\n• The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset-\nliability mismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of\nthe securities leading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in\nlower yield instruments.\nFor details on risk mitigation measures, please refer SID.\n9. Plans/ Options\nPlans: Regular & Direct\nRegular and Direct Plans offer the following options:\n(a) Growth Option\n(b) Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) Option\nUnder this Option, it is proposed to declare income / capital Distribution (IDCW) subject to\navailability of distributable surplus, as computed in accordance with SEBI (MF) Regulations.\nInvestors should note that distributions can be made out of Equalization Reserves (representing\naccumulated realized gains), which is part of sale price paid by them.\n➢ This Option offers following facilities:\n• Payout of IDCW (“Payout”) and\n• Re-investment of IDCW (“Re-investment”)\nDefault Option- Growth\nDefault Facility- Payout\nFor detailed disclosure on default plans and options, kindly refer SAI.\n10. Applicable NAV (after the scheme opens for subscriptions and redemptions)\nThe below cut-off timings and applicability of NAV shall be applicable in respect of valid\napplications received at the Official Point(s) of Acceptance on a Business Day (During Continuous\nOffer Period):\nA] For Purchase (including switch-in) of any amount:\n15\nHDFC Flexi Cap Fund - KIM\n● In respect of valid applications received upto 3.00 p.m. and where the funds for the entire\namount are available for utilization before the cut-off time i.e. credited to the bank account\nof the Scheme before the cut-off time - the closing NAV of the day shall be applicable.\n● In respect of valid applications received after 3.00 p.m. and where the funds for the entire\namount are credited to the bank account of the Scheme either at any time on the same day\nor before the cut-off time of the next Business Day i.e. available for utilization before the\ncut-off time of the next Business Day - the closing NAV of the next Business Day shall be\napplicable.\n● Irrespective of the time of receipt of application, where the funds for the entire amount are\ncredited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time on any subsequent\nBusiness Day i.e. available for utilization before the cut-off time on any subsequent\nBusiness Day - the closing NAV of such subsequent Business Day shall be applicable.\nB] For Switch-ins of any amount:\nFor determining the applicable NAV, the following shall be ensured:\n● Application for switch-in is received before the applicable cut-off time.\n● Funds for the entire amount of subscription/purchase as per the switch-in request are\ncredited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time.\n● The funds are available for utilization before the cut-off time.\n● In case of ‘switch’ transactions from one scheme to another, the allocation shall be in line\nwith redemption payouts.\nIn case of switches, the request should be received on a day which is a Business Day for\nthe Switch-out scheme.

WHERE WILL THE SCHEME INVEST?\nThe Scheme will invest in securities as mentioned below. The investments will be made as per the limits\nspecified in the asset allocation table of the Scheme, subject to permissible limits laid under SEBI (MF)\nRegulations or any other applicable laws and guidelines.\n• Equity and equity related instruments\n• Debt and Money Market Instruments\n• Short Term deposits\n• Units of mutual funds\n• REITs and InvITs\n• Derivatives\n• Investment in overseas securities shall be made in accordance with the requirements stipulated by SEBI\nand RBI from time to time.\nAny other instruments as may be permitted by RBI / SEBI from time to time, subject to necessary regulatory\napprovals.\nFor detailed disclosures, kindly refer Section II.\nC. WHAT ARE THE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES?\nThe investment objective of the scheme is to generate capital appreciation / income from a portfolio,\npredominantly of equity & equity related instruments.\nThe aim of equity strategy will be to build a portfolio of companies diversified across major industries,\neconomic sectors and market capitalization that offer an acceptable risk reward balance.\nInvestment in debt securities and money market instruments will be as per the limits in the asset allocation\ntable of the scheme, subject to permissible limits laid under SEBI (MF) Regulations. Investment in debt\nsecurities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their outlook.\nSubject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may, engage in Stock lending activities.\nThe Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF)\nRegulations.\nThe ELSS (Equity Linked Savings Scheme) guidelines, as applicable, would be adhered to in the\nmanagement of this Scheme.\nAs part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as futures and\noptions, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible in future under\napplicable regulations. However, trading in derivatives by the Scheme shall be for restricted purposes as\npermitted by the regulations.\n12\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\nFor detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI.\nThough every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the\nAMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved.\nNo guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme.\nRisk Control\nInvestments made by the Scheme would be in accordance with the investment objectives of the scheme and\nprovisions of SEBI (MF) Regulations. Since investing requires disciplined risk management, the AMC would\nincorporate adequate safeguards for controlling risks in the portfolio construction process. The risk control\nprocess involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes that this\ndiversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use\nvarious derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time,\nwith an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest. While these measures\nare expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would\nbe completely eliminated.\nPORTFOLIO TURNOVER\nThe Scheme is an open-ended Scheme. The portfolio is managed from a long term perspective with an\nendeavour to keep portfolio turnover ratio low. However, it is expected that there would be a number of\nsubscriptions and redemptions on a daily basis. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable\nmeasure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage\nand transaction cost.\nD. HOW WILL THE SCHEME BENCHMARK ITS PERFORMANCE?\nNIFTY 500 Index (TRI)\nAs required under clause 1.9 of Master Circular, the benchmark has been selected from amongst those\nnotified by AMFI as the first tier benchmark to be adopted by mutual funds and which are reflective of the\ncategory of the scheme.\nThe NIFTY 500 index represents top 500 companies selected based on full market capitalization from the\neligible universe. The performance will be benchmarked to the Total Returns Variant of the Index.\nThe Trustee reserves the right to change the benchmark for evaluation of performance of the Scheme from\ntime to time in conformity with the investment objectives and appropriateness of the benchmark subject to\nSEBI (MF) Regulations, and other prevailing guidelines, if any.\nE.

OTHER DETAILS\nA. COMPUTATION OF NAV\nMethodology for Computation of NAV:\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) per Unit of the Scheme will be computed by dividing the net assets of the Scheme\nby the number of Units outstanding under the Scheme on the valuation date. The AMC will value its\ninvestments according to the valuation norms, as specified in Schedule VIII of the SEBI (MF) Regulations, or\nsuch norms as may be specified by SEBI from time to time and as stipulated in the Valuation Policy and\nProcedures of the Fund, provided in SAI available on website.\nIn case of any conflict between the Principles of Fair Valuation and valuation guidelines specified by SEBI,\nthe Principles of Fair Valuation shall prevail.\n18\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\nNAV of Units under each Scheme/ Plan shall be calculated as shown below:\nMarket or Fair Value of the Scheme’s Investments\n+ Current Assets\nNAV (Rs.) - Current Liabilities and Provisions\n= _______________________________________________\nper Unit\nNo. of Units outstanding under the\nScheme/Plan\nThe NAV of the Scheme will be calculated and disclosed at the close of every Business Day.\nSeparate NAV will be calculated and announced for each of Plans/Options. The NAVs will be calculated upto\n3 decimals. Units will be allotted upto 3 decimals.\nIllustration for Computation of NAV:\nNAV for the Scheme shall be calculated as shown below:\nParticulars Amount (In INR)\nAssets\nInvestments (at Market Value) 10,000\n(Equity/Debt/Derivatives)\nCurrent Assets\nInterest receivable 1,000\nDividend Receivables 550\nTrades Receivables 1,500\nTotal Assets (A) 13,050\nCurrent Liabilities\nTrade Payables 1,500\nExpense Payable 25\nDividend payable 25\nTotal Liabilities (B) 1,550\nNet Assets (C) (A – B) 11,500\nUnits Outstanding (D) 1,000\nNAV per unit (C/D) ₹ 11.50\nMETHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATION OF SALE AND REPURCHASE PRICE\n19\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\n• Ongoing Price for subscription (purchase)/ switch-in (from other schemes/ plans of the mutual fund)\nby investors. (This is the price you need to pay for purchase/ switch-in):\nThe Sale Price for a valid purchase will be the Applicable NAV.\ni.e. Sale Price = Applicable NAV\nFor a valid purchase request of Rs. 10,000 where the applicable NAV is Rs. 11.1234, the units allotted will\nbe:\n= 10,000 (i.e. purchase amount)\n11.1234 (i.e. applicable NAV)\n= 899.006 units (rounded to three decimals)\nCharges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above\nillustration.\n• Ongoing Price for redemption (sale)/ switch-outs (to other schemes/plans of the mutual fund) by\ninvestors. (This is the price you will receive for redemptions/ switch-outs):\nThe Repurchase Price for a valid repurchase will be the applicable NAV reduced by any exit load (say 1%).\ni.e. applicable NAV - (applicable NAV X applicable exit load).\nFor a valid repurchase request where the applicable NAV is Rs. 12.1234, the repurchase price will be:\n= 12.1234 - (12.1234 X 1.00%)\n= 12.1234 - 0.1212\n= Rs. 12.0022\nTherefore, for a repurchase of 899.006 units, the proceeds received by the investor will be -\n= 899.006 (units) * 12.0022 (Repurchase price)\n= Rs. 10,790.02 (rounded to two decimals)\nCharges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above\nillustration.\nWhile determining the price of the units, the mutual fund shall ensure that the repurchase price of an open\nended scheme is not lower than 95 per cent of the Net Asset Value.\nFor other details such as policies with respect to computation of NAV, rounding off, investment in foreign\nsecurities, procedure in case of delay in disclosure of NAV etc. refer to SAI.\nB.

DEFINITIONS / INTERPRETATION\nVisit: https://www.hdfcfund.com/statutory-disclosure/offer-document-disclosures\nB. RISK FACTORS\n■ Scheme Specific Risk Factors:\nSome of the specific risk factors related to the Scheme include, but are not limited to the following:\nScheme Specific Risk Factors:\nUnits of the Scheme (including Units allotted under Reinvestment of IDCW) cannot be\nassigned/transferred/pledged/redeemed/switched out until completion of three years from the date of\nallotment of the respective Units.\n(i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments\n• Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily\nbasis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and\ninvestors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks.\n• Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a\nlarger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment\nin such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk.\n• While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these\ninvestments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the\nScheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold.\n• Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in\nthe debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances.\n(ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities\n• The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market\ninstruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme\nis expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase\nin the level of interest rates.\n• Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may\nrestrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security\nis finally sold.\n• Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of\nthe issuers.\n• Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of\nan issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which\nmay have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in\neconomic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions\nspecific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit\nquality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will\nendeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis.\n• Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities\nbefore their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such prepayment\n25\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\nmay force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields,\nresulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n• Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the\nsecurities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on\ninterest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be\nlower than that originally assumed.\n• Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and\nsuch periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems\nin settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are\nuninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities\npurchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment\nopportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the\nabsence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in\npotential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in\nthe Scheme's portfolio.\n• Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed income\nsecurity. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest\nrates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing\ncoupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of\ninterest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels\nat which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government\nSecurities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the\nsense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by\nmovement in interest rates in the financial system.\n• Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme\nInformation Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may\nincrease or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level\nof risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are\ncomparatively less risky than AA rated bonds.\n• The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated\nsecurities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may\nincrease the absolute level of risk of the portfolio.\n• As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these\nsecurities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk.\nTherefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in\nzero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero\ncoupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic\npayment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current\ninterest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount\ndepends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest.\nIt also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived\ncredit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than\nthe market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.\n(iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities:\n• Except for any security of an associate or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which\nare not listed on a stock exchange (“unlisted Securities”) which in general are subject to greater price\nfluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted\ndebt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme\nwill realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value.\n• Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than\nrated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer-specific developments. Such investments\n26\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\ndisplay increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic\nenvironment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities\ntend to be less liquid than rated debt securities.\n(iv) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE)\nrated securities\nThe risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition to the\nrisk factors associated with debt instruments.\n• Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement\nfor the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in various forms and\ncould include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter of comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity\ncould be either related or non-related to the issuer like a bank, financial institution, etc. Credit\nenhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges,\netc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by\nhypothecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables\netc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluation of the credit enhancement provider, as well as the\nissuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan\npools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer.\n• Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit\nenhancements. Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit\nenhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the liquidity in the\nmarket for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt instruments. Hence,\nlower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments\nand generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold.\n• Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength\nof the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could\nhave an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to\ninability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the\nunderlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk\nof servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore,\napart from issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit\nrisk.\n(v) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo\nThe mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing\nCorporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri-party\nRepo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL;\nThus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments.\nThe members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the\ndefault fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in\ncase of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL).\nAs per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default\nfund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL's\ncontribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non-\ndefaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution\nbeing invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In addition, the fund contribution is\nallowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting\nmember).\n27\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\nCCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to\nmeet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and the other for\nmeeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades. The mutual fund is\nexposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of\nthe mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by CCIL, as a result\nthe scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund.\n(vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities\n● Currency Risk:\nMoving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets\nof the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the Indian Rupee\nequivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value\nof certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee.\n● Interest Rate Risk:\nThe pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related, can differ\nsignificantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed to\ntheir interest rate cycles.\n● Credit Risk:\nInvestment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and\nprincipal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is\nsubstantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in debt instruments with\nrating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency.\n● Taxation Risk:\nIn addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information (SAI)\nunder section “Special Consideration”, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges\nbased on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher\nlevel of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation.\nThe Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its\ninvestment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing /\nevolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All these may entail a\nhigher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting its\nNAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor.\n● Legal and Regulatory Risk:\nLegal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it.\nIf any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should\nbe enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject could differ\nmaterially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the\ninvestors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively.\n● Country Risk:\nThe Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk\nencompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect\nforeign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction\nof extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of\nthe overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of\ntrades or otherwise.\n28\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\n● To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use\nderivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may\nbe stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time.\n• Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities:\nIn case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by regulatory\nbodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in permissible Overseas\nSecurities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity.\n(vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives\n● The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an attempt\nto protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products are specialized\ninstruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those associated with\nstocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument\nbut of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability\nof derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices.\n● Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as\ndisproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund\nmanager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the\nfund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No\nassurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies.\n● The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks\nassociated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.\n● Credit Risk:\nThe credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and\nis generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction.\n● Market Risk:\nMarket movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives.\n● Illiquidity risk:\nThis is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of\nliquidity in the market.\nAdditional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate Futures\n(IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used\nto hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the\ngain from the hedge position entered using the IRF.\n(viii) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending\nAs with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the\nrisk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the\nagreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary.\nSuch failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities,\nthe inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible\nloss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved\nintermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity\n& loss of opportunity.\n29\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\n(ix) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt\nThe Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent\nthat the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive.\n● Limited Liquidity & Price Risk\nThere is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the\nability of the investor to resell them.\n● Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk\nThe Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates\nrepresent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation\nof either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and\nOriginator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors'\nRepresentative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the\nCredit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the\namount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent\ndefault of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However,\nmany factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required\nto realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may\nbe lower than the amount due from that Obligor.\n● Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs\nIn the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge\nOffs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs).\n● Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility\nIf the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor could\nexperience losses or delays in the payments.\n● Risk of Co-mingling\nWith respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the\nCollection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing\nthe same into the Collection account especially considering that some of the collections may be in the\nform of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from\nother funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors,\nthe Investors may be exposed to a potential loss.\n(x) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI)\nPerpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile.\nSome of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital\nRegulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory guidelines for\nissuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds as per guidelines issued by RBI. The\ninstruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated\nwith these instruments are highlighted below:\nKey Risk Factors:\n- Risk on coupon servicing\nBanks\nAs per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/\npayment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses\n30\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\nor inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow banks to make payment of\ncoupons.\nNBFCs\nWhile NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can also be\ndeferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios.\nCorporates\nCorporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually\ncumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI.\n- Risk of write-down or conversion into equity\nBanks\nAs per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET-\n1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written down. Further,\nAT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in\nthe event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank\nis deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds\nor a public sector capital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector\ninjection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates.\n- Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer\nBanks\nThe issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period from the\ndate of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does not exercise the\ncall on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call\nexercise date.\nNBFCs\nThe NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per the\nregulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines.\nHowever, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have to hold the instruments\nfor a period beyond the first call exercise date.\nCorporates\nThere is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the call option,\nthe Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise date.\n(xi) Risk factors associated with Short Selling\nShort-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he\nborrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted\nand returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the\nstock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short\nsale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss.\nThus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited\nif the price increases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio.\n31\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\n(xii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:\n● Price Risk:\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis\nowing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market\nconditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of\ninterest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures.\n● Interest Rate Risk:\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise,\nprices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n● Credit Risk:\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment\nor even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs\nare likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled.\n● Liquidity Risk:\nThis refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no\nassurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time\nwhen trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a\ndiscount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments for which a liquid market exists.\nAs these products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk.\n● Reinvestment Risk:\nInvestments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could\nbe repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay-outs, etc.\nConsequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns.\n● Legal and Regulatory Risk\nThe regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs\ncomprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement\nby regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new\nlaws, regulations or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the\nsector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change\nin a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business,\ncompete effectively or make distributions.\n(xiii) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes\n1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any\nchange in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the\nperformance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes.\n2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads.\n(xiv) General Risk factors\n• Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the\ninvestments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different\nsettlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances\nleading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme\ncan go up or down because of various factors that affect the capital markets in general.\n32\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\n• As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes\nand settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be significant in\nthe event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view\nof the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending\nredemptions) under certain circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption\nand / or Suspend Redemption of the units.\n• At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest\nin securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash\nor cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to\nsubstantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments\nin cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity requirements.\n• Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the\nportfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to medium term period.\n• Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may\ninclude changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies.\n• The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset-liability\nmismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities\nleading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments.\nC. RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES\nRisk Mitigation measures for investments in equity / equity related and debt instruments\n• The Scheme aims to maintain a well-diversified equity portfolio comprising stocks across various sectors\nof the economy. This shall aid in managing concentration risk and sector specific risks.\n• The Scheme targets to maintain exposure across different market cap segments - i.e. large, mid-cap and\nsmall cap. This shall aid in managing volatility and also improve liquidity.\n• Any investments in debt securities would be undertaken after assessing the associated credit risk,\ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk.\nCredit Evaluation Policy\nThe credit evaluation policy of the AMC entails evaluation of credit fundamentals of each investment\nopportunity. Some of the factors that are evaluated inter-alia may include outlook on the sector, parentage,\nquality of management, and overall financial strength of the credit. The AMC utilises ratings of recognized\nrating agencies as an input in the credit evaluation process. Investments in bonds and debenture are usually\nin instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by a recognized rating agency.\nIn line with clause 12.12 of Master Circular, the AMC may constitute committee(s) to approve proposals for\ninvestments in unrated instruments. The AMC Board and the Trustee shall approve the detailed parameters\nfor such investments. The details of such investments would be communicated by the AMC to the Trustee in\ntheir periodical reports. It would also be clearly mentioned in the reports, how the parameters have been\ncomplied with. However, in case any security does not fall under the parameters, the prior approval of Board\nof AMC and Trustee shall be sought.\nLiquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to sell / liquidate a security at short notice at\nprevailing market prices or without incurring impact cost. While government bonds, money market\ninstruments and shorter maturity instruments are generally easier to sell, corporate bonds and other\ninstruments typically face higher liquidity risk. Further, higher rated securities normally are more liquid\ncompared to lower rated securities. As a result, different portfolios will face different levels of liquidity risk\nbased on the underlying portfolio composition. Some of the strategies to reduce liquidity risk are creating\nportfolios that are diversified across maturities, ratings, types of securities, etc. in line with the fund\nobjectives, regulations and investment strategy.\n33\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\nCredit Risk: Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities. Hence,\ncredit risk faced by different schemes will be different based on the underlying portfolio / investment\nstrategy. To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be\nundertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors\n(parentage, track record etc.). Each of the scheme/portfolio will endeavour to maintain adequate\ndiversification across issuers / sectors in line with scheme objectives, regulations and investment\nstrategy. Unrated investments, if any, would require specific approval from a committee constituted for\nthe purpose.\nDebt Derivatives Risk: The AMC has provision for using derivative instruments for portfolio balancing\nand hedging purposes. Interest Rate Swaps will be done with approved counter parties under pre\napproved ISDA agreements. Mark to Market of swaps, netting off of cash flow and default provision\nclauses will be provided as per standard practice on a reciprocal basis. Interest Rate Swaps and other\nderivative instruments will be used as per local (RBI and SEBI) regulatory guidelines.\nInterest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk of change in the NAVs due to change in overall market\nyields. The change in value of a security, for a given change in yield, is higher for a security with higher\nduration and vice versa. Hence portfolios with higher duration will have higher volatility. The AMC shall\nstrive to actively manage the duration of the respective funds based on the prevailing market conditions\n/ outlook of interest rates, keeping in mind the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable\nregulations.\nConcentration Risk: The AMC will attempt to mitigate this risk by maintaining adequate diversification\nacross issuers/ sectors / instrument type in line with the scheme objectives, investment strategy and\napplicable regulations. This will also be managed by keeping prudent investment limits on any particular\nindustry or issuer or issuer group based on the size, credit profile, etc. to reduce issuer or industry specific\nrisk.\nRisk Mitigation factors relating to investment in Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI):\n• Risk on coupon servicing and Risk of write-down or conversion into equity\nBanks: The risks on coupon servicing or principal write down/ conversion to equity are mitigated, to a certain\nextent, if the investee bank has strong financial position and meets the required regulatory guidelines. Hence,\nan in-depth credit evaluation of each bank is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage,\nprofitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.).\nGiven the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable\nsurplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed.\nInvestment is done only in the AT-1 bonds of banks with strong credit worthiness, in our assessment. This,\nin turn, reduces the risk of its capital position falling below regulatory requirements and / or reaching PONV.\nRisk of write-down or conversion into equity is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates.\n• Risk on coupon servicing\nNBFCs\nThese risks are mitigated, to certain extent, if the investee NBFC has strong financial position and meets the\nrequired regulatory guidelines. Hence, an in-depth credit evaluation of each NBFC is undertaken, keeping in\nmind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors\n(parentage, track record etc.). Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track\nrecord of profitability, distributable surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to\ninfuse capital, in case it is needed.\n34\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\nCorporates\nTo mitigate this risk, an in-depth credit evaluation of each corporate is undertaken, keeping in mind both\nquantitative (leverage, profitability, industry position, market share etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage,\ntrack record etc.). Additionally, given that the coupon is usually cumulative in nature and the corporate is\nrestricted from paying any dividends till all previous dues are paid to the perpetual bond investor, the company\nhas adequate incentive to not defer coupon on PDIs.\n• Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer\nBanks\nWhile the issuer bank does have an option to not exercise the first call, experience suggests that all Indian\nbanks till now have exercised the call option during the call period. We believe that banks are cognizant of\nthe investor sensitivities with regards to risk of not exercising the call option at the first call date. Further, as\nwe invest in issuers with sound credit worthiness, we expect them to understand the importance of exercising\nthe call as the part of their long term capital raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of call option exercise\ncan lead to increase in cost of AT1 bonds for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond\ntenors) and impact the bank's profitability adversely. Given the importance of AT1 instruments for prudently\nmanaging the capital levels and improving the returns for the equity holders, we are of the opinion that banks\nwould choose to service the interest on AT1 bonds and exercise the first call option on AT1 bonds, as they\nhave done in the past. Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual instrument on first call date\n(say due to market disruption), the annual call on these instruments would enable the bank to call the bond\non any of the subsequent annual call options dates.\nNBFCs and Corporates\nWhile the issuer is not obligated to exercise the call option on first call date, the coupon step-up usually\nprovides financial incentive to the Issuer to exercise the call option. Further, as we invest in issuer with sound\ncredit worthiness, we expect them to be cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to exercising the\ncall as the part of their long term resource raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of first call option exercise\ncan lead to increase in cost of PDI for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond tenors)\nand impact the issuer's profitability adversely. Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual\ninstrument on first call date (say due to market disruption), the coupon step up also compensates the investor\nfor extended holding period.\nWhile these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance\nthat these risks would be completely eliminated.\nII. INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCHEME:\nA. WHERE WILL THE SCHEME INVEST?\nThe Scheme will invest in securities as mentioned below. The investments will be made as per the limits\nspecified in the asset allocation table of the Scheme, subject to permissible limits laid under SEBI (MF)\nRegulations or any other applicable laws and guidelines.\nEquity and equity related instruments:\nInvestments in below securities will be as per the investment strategy and as per the limits specified in\nthe asset allocation table of Scheme, subject to permissible limits laid under SEBI (MF) Regulations.\n• Debt securities:\nDebt issuances by various types of issuers such as Government of India, State and local Governments,\nGovernment Agencies and statutory bodies, Corporate Entities, Public / Private sector undertakings, Public\n35\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\n/ Private sector banks and development financial institutions, etc. Debt issuances may include but are not\nlimited to:\n1.

The appointment of such intermediaries shall be in\naccordance with the applicable requirements of SEBI and within the permissible ceilings of expenses as\nstated under Regulation 52 of SEBI (MF) Regulations.\n• Investment in Securitised Debt\nA securitisation transaction involves sale of receivables by the originator (a bank, non-banking finance\ncompany, housing finance company, or a manufacturing/service company) to a Special Purpose Vehicle\n(SPV), typically set up in the form of a trust. Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs),\nthe proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator. In this manner, the originator, by selling\nhis loan receivables to an SPV, receives consideration from investors much before the maturity of the\nunderlying loans. Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying loans from borrowers. Typically,\nthe transaction is provided with a limited amount of credit enhancement (as stipulated by the rating agency\nfor a target rating), which provides protection to investors against defaults by the underlying borrowers.\nGenerally available asset classes for securitisation in India are:\n● Commercial vehicles\n● Auto and two wheeler pools\n● Mortgage pools (residential housing loans)\n● Personal loan, credit card and other retail loans\n● Corporate loans/receivables\nInvestment / Risk Mitigation Strategy\n1. Risk profile of securitised debt vis-à-vis risk appetite of the Scheme\nThe risk profile of securitised debt is generally at par with the risk profile of other debt securities at the\nsame level of credit rating. Securitised debt offers additional income (spread) over a debt security of\nsimilar rating and maturity, which enables the scheme to optimize its income without taking any additional\n38\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\ncredit risk. Securitised debt is generally less liquid, however, investment in securitised debt is made to\nmaintain a diversified portfolio of debt securities that optimizes return without increasing the overall risk\nprofile of the Scheme.\n2. Policy relating to originators based on nature of originator, track record, NPAs, losses in earlier\nsecuritised debt, etc\nThe originator is an entity (like banks, non-banking finance companies, corporates etc), which has initially\nprovided the loan & is also generally responsible for servicing the loans. The schemes will invest in\nsecuritised debt of originators with at least investment grade credit rating and established track record. A\ndetailed evaluation of originator is done before the investment is made in securitised debt of any originator\non various parameters given below:\n● Track record\nThe investment in securitised debt is done based on origination and underwriting process and\ncapabilities of the originator, overview of corporate structure, group to which they belong, experience\nof the company in the business & how long they have been in the business, financial condition of the\ncompany, credit rating, past performance of similar pools by the originator, etc.\n● Willingness to pay through credit enhancement facilities etc.\nCredit enhancement is provided by the originator, as indicated by rating agencies, so as to adequately\ncover the defaults and acts as a risk mitigation measure. The size of the credit enhancement as\nindicated by rating agency depends on the originator's track record, past delinquencies, pattern of the\nportfolio & characteristics of the pool vis-a-vis of the portfolio, nature of the asset class.\n● Ability to pay\nThe quality of the origination impacts the performance of the underlying asset & thus originators with\nstrong systems and processes in place can eliminate poor quality assets. A robust risk management\nsystem of the originator and availability of MIS reports on timely basis, results in creation of strong\nasset portfolio.\n● Business Risk Assessment\nThe business risk assessment of originator / underlying borrower also includes detailed credit\nassessment wherein following factors are also considered:\n- Outlook for the economy (domestic and global)\n- Outlook for the industry\n- Company specific factors\nIn addition, a detailed review and assessment of rating rationale is done along with interactions with\nthe company as well as the rating agency. All investment in securitised debt is done after taking into\naccount, the Critical Evaluation Parameters (for pool loan and single loan securitisation transactions)\nregarding the originator / underlying issuer as mentioned below:\n● Default track record/ frequent alteration of redemption conditions / covenants\n● High leverage ratios of the ultimate borrower (for single-sell downs) - both on a standalone basis\nas well on a consolidated level/ group level\n● Higher proportion of reschedulement of underlying assets of the pool or loan, as the case may be\n● Higher proportion of overdue assets of the pool or the underlying loan, as the case may be\n● Poor reputation in market\n● Insufficient track record of servicing of the pool or the loan, as the case may be.\n3. Risk mitigation strategies for investments with each kind of originator\nInvestments are based on assessment of following parameters, so as to mitigate risk associated with\nsuch investment:\na. Credit quality, size and reach of the originator\n39\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\nb. Nature of receivables/asset category i.e. cars, construction equipment, commercial vehicles, personal\nloans etc.\nc. Collection process, infrastructure and follow-up mechanism\nd. Quality of MIS\ne. Credit cum liquidity enhancement\nf. Credit appraisal norms of originator\ng. Asset Quality - portfolio delinquency levels\nh. Past performance of rated pools\ni. Pool Characteristics - seasoning, Loan-to-value ratios, geographic diversity etc.\n4. The level of diversification with respect to the underlying assets, and risk mitigation measures for\nless diversified investments\nDiversification of underlying assets is achieved through a) prudent mix of asset categories - i.e. cars (new,\nused), commercial vehicles, construction equipment, unsecured loans to individuals or small & medium\nenterprises b) total number of contracts in a pool c) average ticket size of loans and d) geographical\ndistribution.\nRisk mitigation measures for less diversified investments in pools is accomplished through the size of\ncredit enhancement, seasoning or loan to value ratios.\nIllustrative framework, which will be applied while evaluating investment decision relating to a pool\nsecuritisation transaction:\nCharacteristics/ Mortgage Commercial Car 2 Micro Personal Single Others\nType of Pool Loan Vehicle and wheelers Finance Loans Sell\nConstruction Pools Downs\nEquipment\nApproximate\n12-60 8-40\nAverage maturity (in NA 12-60 months NA NA\nmonths months\nMonths)\nCollateral margin\n(including cash,\nguarantees, excess NA 5-20% 4-15% 4-15% NA NA\ninterest spread,\nsubordinate tranche)\nAverage Loan to Refer Refer\nNA 80-95% 70-90% 70-95% NA NA\nValue Ratio Note A Note B\nAverage seasoning 3-8 2-5\nNA 3-8 months NA NA\nof the Pool months months\nMaximum single NA NA\nexposure range NA 3-7% (Retail (Retail NA NA\npool) Pool)\nAverage single\nNA 1-5% 0-1% 0-1% NA NA\nexposure range %\nNA - Not Applicable\nInformation in the table above is based on current scenario and is subject to change depending upon the\nchange in related factors.\n40\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\nNotes:\nA. In case of securitised debt with underlying being single loan, the investment limit applicable to the\nunderlying borrower is considered.\nB. Other investment will be decided on a case to case basis.\nIn case of asset backed pools (ABS), evaluation of the pool assets is done considering the following\nfactors: (Refer the table above which illustrates the averages of parameters considered while selecting\nthe pool)\n• Size of the loan\n• Average original maturity of the pool\n• Loan to Value Ratio\n• Average seasoning of the pool\n• Default rate distribution\n• Geographical Distribution\n• Credit enhancement facility\n• Liquid facility\n• Structure of the pool\n5. Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation\nThe illustrative average seasoning of the debt by originator prior to securitisation is given above in table\n(Refer Point 4).\nMinimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation in the case of asset pools is in\nthe form of seasoning of loans to various asset classes (cars, commercial vehicles, etc.) and generally\nvaries from one month to six months depending on the nature of asset.\n6. Minimum retention percentage by originator of debts to be securitised\nWhile minimum retention percentage by originator is not prescribed, any amount retained by the originator\nthrough subordination is viewed positively at the time of making investment and generally varies from 5%\nto 10%.\n7. The mechanism to tackle conflict of interest when the mutual fund invests in securitised debt of\nan originator and the originator in turn makes investments in that particular scheme of the fund\nAll proposals for investment in securitised debt are evaluated by the credit analyst based on several\nparameters such as nature of underlying asset category, pool characteristics, asset quality, credit rating\nof the securitisation transaction, and credit cum liquidity enhancement available. Investment in securitised\ndebt in any scheme is made by the respective fund manager in line with the investment objective of that\nscheme.\n8. The resources and mechanism of individual risk assessment with the AMC for monitoring\ninvestment in securitised debt (in general)\nInvestment in securitised debt is monitored regularly with regards to its performance on various\nparameters such as collection efficiency, delinquencies, prepayments and utilization of credit\nenhancement. Information on these parameters is available through monthly reports from Pool Trustees\nand through information disseminated by the rating agencies. Monthly performance report is released by\nthe credit analyst to the fund management team and the fund management team periodically reviews the\nsame.\nTrading in Derivatives\n• The Scheme may take derivatives position based on the opportunities available subject to the guidelines\nprovided by SEBI from time to time and in line with the overall investment objective of the Scheme.\n41\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\n• The Scheme intends to use derivatives mainly for the purpose of hedging and portfolio balancing. Losses\nmay arise as a result of using derivatives, but these are likely to be compensated by the gains on the\nunderlying cash instruments held by the Scheme.\n• The Scheme may take position in derivative instruments like Futures, Options, and such other derivative\ninstruments as may be permitted by SEBI from time to time.\nExposure to Derivatives\nThe Scheme may take exposure to derivatives. For details, refer section ‘What are the investment\nstrategies’ under Section I, Part II, Clause C.\nThe exposure limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by SEBI vide its clause 12.25 of\nMaster Circular and as amended from time to time are as follows:\nThe limits on derivatives exposure per scrip/instrument and derivatives positions and limits are as per the\ntable below.\nThe maximum limit for each derivative position is as under:\nSr. No. Derivative Action Description Limits\nIndex Buy Buy futures against cash to To the extent of cash / equivalents\n1.\nfutures protect against in the portfolio.\nrising market Max. limit (10%) of portfolio\nIndex Buy Buy index calls against cash To the extent of cash / equivalents\n2.\nOptions - (existing /expected) to in the portfolio\nCall protect against rising market Max. limit (10%) of portfolio\nStock Buy Buy against cash to protect To the extent of cash / equivalents\n3.\nfutures against rising share prices in the portfolio\nMax. limit (10%) of portfolio; per\nscrip limit (4%)\nStock Sell Sell against existing stock - To the extent of the particular scrip\n4.\nfutures Hedging against downside holding in the portfolio; per scrip\non existing stock in the face limit (10%)\nof expected volatility in the\nstock price\nStock Buy Buy against cash to protect To the extent of cash / equivalents\n5.\noptions – against rising share price in the portfolio.

Definition of Exposure in case of Derivative Positions\nEach position taken in derivatives shall have an associated exposure as defined under. Exposure\nis the maximum possible loss that may occur on a position. However, certain derivative positions\nmay theoretically have unlimited possible loss. Exposure in derivative positions shall be computed\nas follows:\nPosition Exposure\nLong Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts\nShort Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts\nOption Bought Option Premium Paid * Lot Size * Number of Contracts\nExposure limits on Credit Default Swaps (CDS)\n44\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\nExposure through CDS (Notional amount of both CDS bought and sold) shall not exceed 10% of AUM\nof scheme and shall be within the overall limit of derivatives.\nExposure limits on Interest Rate Futures (IRF)\nThe exposure limits for trading in Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) by Mutual Funds specified by clause\n12.25.9 of Master Circular are as follows:\ni. To reduce interest rate risk in a debt portfolio, mutual funds may hedge the portfolio or part of the\nportfolio (including one or more securities) on weighted average modified duration basis by using\nInterest Rate Futures (IRFs). The maximum extent of short position that may be taken in IRFs to hedge\ninterest rate risk of the portfolio or part of the portfolio, is as per the formula given below:\n(Portfolio Modified Duration*\nMarket Value of the Portfolio)\n(Futures Modified Duration *Futures Price/PAR)\nii. In case the IRF used for hedging the interest rate risk has different underlying security(s) than the\nexisting position being hedged, it would result in imperfect hedging.\niii. Imperfect hedging using IRFs may be considered to be exempted from the gross exposure, upto\nmaximum of 20% of the net assets of the scheme, subject to the following:\na) Exposure to IRFs is created only for hedging the interest rate risk based on the weighted average\nmodified duration of the bond portfolio or part of the portfolio.\nb) Mutual Funds are permitted to resort to imperfect hedging, without it being considered under the\ngross exposure limits, if and only if, the correlation between the portfolio or part of the portfolio\n(excluding the hedged portions, if any) and the IRF is atleast 0.9 at the time of initiation of hedge.\nIn case of any subsequent deviation from the correlation criteria, the same may be rebalanced\nwithin 5 working days and if not rebalanced within the timeline, the derivative positions created for\nhedging shall be considered under the gross exposure computed in terms of clause 12.24.1 of\nMaster Circular. The correlation should be calculated for a period of last 90 days.\nExplanation: If the fund manager intends to do imperfect hedging upto 15% of the portfolio using\nIRFs on weighted average modified duration basis, either of the following conditions need to be\ncomplied with:\ni. The correlation for past 90 days between the portfolio and the IRF is at least 0.9 or\nii. The correlation for past 90 days between the part of the portfolio (excluding the hedged\nportions, if any) i.e. at least 15% of the net asset of the scheme (including one or more\nsecurities) and the IRF is at least 0.9.\nc) At no point of time, the net modified duration of part of the portfolio being hedged should be\nnegative.\nd) The portion of imperfect hedging in excess of 20% of the net assets of the scheme should be\nconsidered as creating exposure and shall be included in the computation of gross exposure in\nterms of clause 12.24.1 of Master Circular.\n• Debt Market In India\nThe instruments available in Indian Debt Market are classified into two categories, namely Government and\nNon - Government debt. The instruments available in these categories include:\nA] Government Debt\n45\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\nCentral Government Debt\nTreasury Bills\nDated Government Securities\n– Coupon Bearing Bonds\n– Floating Rate Bonds\n– Zero Coupon Bonds\nState Government Debt\n– State Government Loans\n– Coupon Bearing Bonds\nB] Non-Government Debt\nInstruments issued by Government Agencies and other Statutory Bodies\nGovernment Guaranteed Bonds\nPSU Bonds\nInstruments issued by Public Sector Undertakings\nCommercial Paper\nPSU Bonds\nFixed Coupon Bonds\nFloating Rate Bonds\nZero Coupon Bonds\nInstruments issued by Banks and Development Financial Institutions\nCertificates of Deposit\nPromissory Notes\nBonds\nFixed Coupon Bonds\nFloating Rate Bonds\nZero Coupon Bonds\nInstruments issued by Corporate Bodies\nCommercial Paper\nNon-Convertible Debentures\nFixed Coupon Debentures\nFloating Rate Debentures\nZero Coupon Debentures\nPass Through Securities\nActivity in the Primary and Secondary Market is dominated by Central Government Securities including\nTreasury Bills. These instruments comprise close to 60% of all outstanding debt and more than 75% of the\ndaily trading volume on the Wholesale Debt Market Segment of the National Stock Exchange of India Limited.\nIn the money market, activity levels of the Government and Non- Government Debt vary from time to time.\nInstruments that comprise a major portion of money market activity include,\nOvernight Call\nRepo/Reverse Repo Agreements\nTri-party Repos on Government securities or treasury bills (TREPS)\nTreasury Bills\nGovernment Securities with a residual maturity of < 1 year\nCommercial Paper\n46\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\nCertificates of Deposit\nBills Rediscounting Scheme\nThough not strictly classified as Money Market Instruments, PSU/ DFI / Corporate paper with a residual\nmaturity of < 1 year, are actively traded and offer a viable investment option.\nThe following table gives approximate yields prevailing during the month ended March 31, 2025 on some of\nthe instruments. These yields are indicative and do not indicate yields that may be obtained in future as\ninterest rates keep changing consequent to changes in macro economic conditions and RBI policy.\nInstrument Yield Range\n(% per annum)\nInter bank Call Money 5.75 -6.40\n91 Day Treasury Bill 6.34 -6.56\n364 Day Treasury Bill 6.44 -6.56\nA1 + Commercial Paper 90 Days 7.38 -7.65\n5 Year Government of India Security 6.45 -6.66\n10 Year Government of India Security 6.58 -6.75\n15 Year Government of India Security 6.692 - 6.924\n1 Year Corporate Bond - AAA Rated 7.63 -7.80\n3 Year Corporate Bond - AAA Rated 7.34 -7.48\n5 Year Corporate Bond - AAA Rated 7.33 -7.45\nSource: Bloomberg\nThese yields are indicative and do not indicate yields that may be obtained in future as interest rates keep\nchanging consequent to changes in macro economic conditions and RBI policy. The price and yield on various\ndebt instruments fluctuate from time to time depending upon the macro economic situation, inflation rate,\noverall liquidity position, foreign exchange scenario etc. Also, the price and yield vary according to maturity\nprofile, credit risk etc.\nGenerally, for instruments issued by a non-Government entity (corporate / PSU bonds), the yield is higher\nthan the yield on a Government Security with corresponding maturity. The difference, known as credit spread,\ndepends on the credit rating of the entity.\n• Overseas Debt Market\nThe nature and number of debt instruments available in international debt markets is very wide. In terms of\ndiverse instruments as well as liquidity, overseas debt markets offer great depth and are extremely well\ndeveloped.\nInvestment in international debt greatly expands the universe of top quality debt, which is no longer restricted\nto the limited papers available in the domestic debt market. The higher rated overseas sovereign, quasi-\ngovernment and corporate debt offer lower default risk in addition to offering a high degree of liquidity since\nthese are traded across major international markets. Investments in rated international debt offer multiple\nbenefits of risk reduction, a much wider universe of top quality debt and also potential gains from currency\nmovements.\n47\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver-SID\nInvestments in international markets are most often in U.S. dollars, though the Euro, Pound Sterling and the\nYen are also major currencies.

In case the\nportfolio of the scheme is not rebalanced within the aforementioned mandated plus extended\ntimelines, the AMC shall follow the requirements specified under the aforesaid circular including\nreporting the deviation to Trustees at each stage.\n7. Investment Strategy\nThe investment objective of the scheme is to generate capital appreciation / income from a portfolio,\npredominantly of equity & equity related instruments.\nThe aim of equity strategy will be to build a portfolio of companies diversified across major industries,\neconomic sectors and market capitalization that offer an acceptable risk reward balance.\nInvestment in debt securities and money market instruments will be as per the limits in the asset\nallocation table of the scheme, subject to permissible limits laid under SEBI (MF) Regulations.\nInvestment in debt securities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their outlook.\nSubject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may, engage in Stock lending\nactivities.\n4\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver - KIM\nThe Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF)\nRegulations.\nThe ELSS (Equity Linked Savings Scheme) guidelines, as applicable, would be adhered to in the\nmanagement of this Scheme.\nAs part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as\nfutures and options, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible in\nfuture under applicable regulations. However, trading in derivatives by the Scheme shall be for\nrestricted purposes as permitted by the regulations.\nFor detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI.\nThough every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the\nAMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be\nachieved. No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme.\n8. Risk Profile of the Scheme\nMutual Fund Units involve investment risks including the possible loss of principal. Please read the\ndetails on risk factors carefully before investment. Scheme specific Risk Factors are summarized\nbelow:\nScheme Specific Risk Factors:\nUnits of the Scheme (including Units allotted under Reinvestment of IDCW) cannot be\nassigned/transferred/pledged/redeemed/switched out until completion of three years from the date of\nallotment of the respective Units.\n(i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments\n Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a\ndaily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of\nrisk and investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks.\n Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and\ncarry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the\nexchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk.\n While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell\nthese investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may\nlead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold.\n Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments\nheld in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal\ncircumstances.\n(ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities\n The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market\ninstruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the\nScheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely\naffected by an increase in the level of interest rates.\n Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which\nmay restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till\nthe security is finally sold.\n5\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver - KIM\n Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term\nrating of the issuers.\n Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the\nrisk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any\nother issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions\nof an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic\nor and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an\nadverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may increase the risk of\nthe portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house\ncredit analysis.\n Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its\nsecurities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of\nsuch prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in\nsecurities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received\nfrom the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is\nthe \"interest on interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can\nbe reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed.\n Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement\nperiods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays\nor other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the\nassets of the Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the\nScheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the\nScheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held\nin the Scheme's portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market\nfor debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a\nsubsequent decline in the value of securities held in the Scheme's portfolio.\n Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed income\nsecurity. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when\ninterest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of\nthe existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest\nrates. The new level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises\nnew money and/or the price levels at which the market is already dealing in existing securities.\nThe price-risk is not unique to Government Securities. It exists for all fixed income securities.\nHowever, Government Securities are unique in the sense that their credit risk generally\nremains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by movement in interest rates in the\nfinancial system.\n Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the\nScheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the\nScheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate\nbonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate\nbonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated bonds.\n The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated /\nunrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive\nyields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio.\n As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the\nsecurity, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to\nissuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The\nAMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may\nincrease the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that\n6\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver - KIM\ndo not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date\nwhen the securities begin paying current interest and therefore, are generally issued and\ntraded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the time remaining until\nmaturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It also varies depending on\nthe prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived credit risk of the Issuer.\nThe market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices\nof securities that pay interest periodically.\n(iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities:\n Except for any security of an associate or group company, the scheme can invest in securities\nwhich are not listed on a stock exchange (“unlisted Securities”) which in general are subject to\ngreater price fluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the\nopen market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no\nassurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value.\n Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value\nhigher than rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer-specific developments.\nSuch investments display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a\ndeteriorating economic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be\nmore volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities.\n(iv) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement\n(CE) rated securities\nThe risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition\nto the risk factors associated with debt instruments.\n Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit\nenhancement for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in\nvarious forms and could include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter of comfort, etc. from\nanother entity. This entity could be either related or non-related to the issuer like a bank,\nfinancial institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form of pledge\nof shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed\nsecurities, securitized paper backed by hypothecation of car loan receivables, securities\nbacked by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for CE rated instruments\nevaluation of the credit enhancement provider, as well as the issuer is undertaken to\ndetermine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan pools or\nsecuritization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer.\n Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit\nenhancements. Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due to\nthe credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the\nliquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated\ndebt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the\nscheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact\ncost when such instruments are sold.\n Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined\nstrength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the\nstructure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in\nstructure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues\nsuch as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case of\nSO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases the overall risk for the\n7\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver - KIM\nsecuritized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore, apart from issuer level credit risk\nsuch debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit risk.\n(v) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo\nThe mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the\nClearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities\nand in Tri-party Repo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement\nsystems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for\ntransactions in the said segments. The members are required to contribute an amount as\ncommunicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the\ndefault waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any member in settling\ntransactions routed through CCIL).\nAs per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to\nthe default fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post\nutilization of CCIL's contribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default fund\ncontributions of the non-defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial\nmargin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any settlement\nobligations. In addition, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in\ncase of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member).\nCCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a\nview to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and\nthe other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades.\nThe mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of CCIL, in the\nevent that the contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of\nanother member by CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its\ncontribution to the default fund.\n(vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities\n● Currency Risk:\nMoving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the\nassets of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the Indian\nRupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by\nchanges in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee.\n● Interest Rate Risk:\nThe pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related,\ncan differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme\nstand exposed to their interest rate cycles.\n● Credit Risk:\nInvestment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest\nand principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the\nissuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in\n8\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver - KIM\ndebt instruments with rating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating\nagency.\n● Taxation Risk:\nIn addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional\nInformation (SAI) under section “Special Consideration”, Investment in Foreign Securities\nposes additional challenges based on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The\nscheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation.\nThe Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its\ninvestment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing\n/ evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All these may\nentail a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely\nimpacting its NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor.\n● Legal and Regulatory Risk:\nLegal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely\naffect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or\nregulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may\nbe subject could differ materially from current requirements and may materially and adversely\naffect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed\nretrospectively.\n● Country Risk:\nThe Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk\nencompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might\nadversely affect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include\nevents such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-lateral\nconflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the\nrespective jurisdiction for execution of trades or otherwise.\n● To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund\nmay use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with\nconditions as may be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time.\n Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities:\nIn case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by\nregulatory bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in\npermissible Overseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity.\n(vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives\n● The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an\nattempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products\nare specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from\nthose associated with stocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not\nonly of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of\nmispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate perfectly with\nunderlying assets, rates and indices.\n● Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as\ndisproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of\n9\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver - KIM\nthe fund manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be\npursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always\nbe profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute\nsuch strategies.\n● The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the\nrisks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.\n● Credit Risk:\nThe credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its\nobligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative\ntransaction.\n● Market Risk:\nMarket movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives.\n● Illiquidity risk:\nThis is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to\nlack of liquidity in the market.\nAdditional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate\nFutures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the\nIRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio\nmay not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF.\n(viii) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending\nAs with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including\nthe risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the\nterms of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the\napproved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up\nby the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities\ndeposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from\nthe securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent\nout securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss of opportunity.\n(ix) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt\nThe Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not\nrepresent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive.\n● Limited Liquidity & Price Risk\nThere is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could\nlimit the ability of the investor to resell them.\n● Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk\nThe Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These\nCertificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not\nrepresent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any\naffiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate\nHolders against the Investors' Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause\n10\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver - KIM\ndepletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts\nto the Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit Enhancement\nfacility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to repay his\nobligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However, many factors may affect,\ndelay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required to realise the sale\nproceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may be lower than\nthe amount due from that Obligor.\n● Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs\nIn the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any\nCharge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs).\n● Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility\nIf the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor\ncould experience losses or delays in the payments.\n● Risk of Co-mingling\nWith respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors\ninto the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer\nand depositing the same into the Collection account especially considering that some of the\ncollections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan\nAgreements may not be segregated from other funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as\nServicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to a potential\nloss.\n(x) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI)\nPerpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital\nprofile. Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III\nCapital Regulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory\nguidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds as per guidelines\nissued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity\ndate. The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below:\nKey Risk Factors:\n- Risk on coupon servicing\nBanks\nAs per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel\ndistributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable\nreserves and surpluses or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow\nbanks to make payment of coupons.\nNBFCs\nWhile NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can also\nbe deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital\nratios.\nCorporates\n11\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver - KIM\nCorporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is\nusually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of\nthe PDI.\n- Risk of write-down or conversion into equity\nBanks\nAs per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1\n(CET-1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written\ndown. Further, AT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the\ndiscretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point,\ndetermined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write\noff/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection happens. The write\noff/conversion has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital. This risk is not applicable\nin case of NBFCs and Corporates.\n- Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer\nBanks\nThe issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period\nfrom the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does\nnot exercise the call on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a\nperiod beyond the first call exercise date.\nNBFCs\nThe NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as\nper the regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the\nRBI guidelines. However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have\nto hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date.\nCorporates\nThere is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the call\noption, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise\ndate.\n(xi) Risk factors associated with Short Selling\nShort-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead,\nhe borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he\nshorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller\ncan buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference\nbetween higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates,\nshort selling results in loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money and these losses\nmay grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall result into major\nlosses in the portfolio.\n12\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver - KIM\n(xii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:\n● Price Risk:\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily\nbasis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in\ngeneral market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and\nInfrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer\nprocedures.\n● Interest Rate Risk:\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates\nrise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n● Credit Risk:\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest\npayment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of\nREITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not\nnecessarily be pre scheduled.\n● Liquidity Risk:\nThis refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is\nno assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there\nwould be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid\nunits may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments for\nwhich a liquid market exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be\nexposed to liquidity risk.\n● Reinvestment Risk:\nInvestments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there\ncould be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay-outs, etc.\nConsequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns.\n● Legal and Regulatory Risk\nThe regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs\ncomprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and\nenforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast\nas to how any new laws, regulations or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers of\nREITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the\nregulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply\nwith the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions.\n(xiii) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes\n1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance.\nAny change in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect\nthe performance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes.\n2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads.\n(xiv) General Risk factors\n13\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver - KIM\n Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the\ninvestments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have\ndifferent settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen\ncircumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the\nUnits of the Scheme can go up or down because of various factors that affect the capital\nmarkets in general.\nFor details on risk mitigation measures, please refer SID.\n9. Plans/ Options\nPlans: Regular & Direct\nRegular and Direct Plans offer the following options:\n(a) Growth Option\n(b) Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) Option\nUnder this Option, it is proposed to declare income / capital Distribution (IDCW) subject to availability\nof distributable surplus, as computed in accordance with SEBI (MF) Regulations. Investors should\nnote that distributions can be made out of Equalization Reserves (representing accumulated realized\ngains), which is part of sale price paid by them.\n This Option offers following facilities:\n• Payout of IDCW (“Payout”).\nDefault Option- Growth\nFor detailed disclosure on default plans and options, kindly refer SAI.\n10. Applicable NAV (after the scheme opens for subscriptions and redemptions)\nThe below cut-off timings and applicability of NAV shall be applicable in respect of valid applications\nreceived at the Official Point(s) of Acceptance on a Business Day (During Continuous Offer Period):\nA] For Purchase (including switch-in) of any amount:\n● In respect of valid applications received upto 3.00 p.m. and where the funds for the entire\namount are available for utilization before the cut-off time i.e. credited to the bank account of\nthe Scheme before the cut-off time - the closing NAV of the day shall be applicable.\n● In respect of valid applications received after 3.00 p.m. and where the funds for the entire\namount are credited to the bank account of the Scheme either at any time on the same day or\nbefore the cut-off time of the next Business Day i.e. available for utilization before the cut-off\ntime of the next Business Day - the closing NAV of the next Business Day shall be applicable.\n● Irrespective of the time of receipt of application, where the funds for the entire amount are\ncredited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time on any subsequent\nBusiness Day i.e. available for utilization before the cut-off time on any subsequent Business\nDay - the closing NAV of such subsequent Business Day shall be applicable.\nB] For Switch-ins of any amount:\nFor determining the applicable NAV, the following shall be ensured:\n● Application for switch-in is received before the applicable cut-off time.\n● Funds for the entire amount of subscription/purchase as per the switch-in request are credited\nto the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time.\n● The funds are available for utilization before the cut-off time.\n14\nHDFC ELSS Tax saver - KIM\n● In case of ‘switch’ transactions from one scheme to another, the allocation shall be in line with\nredemption payouts.\nIn case of switches, the request should be received on a day which is a Business Day for the\nSwitch-out scheme. Redemption for switch-out shall be processed at the applicable NAV as per\ncut-off timing. Switch-in will be processed at the Applicable NAV (on a Business Day) based on\nrealization of funds as per the redemption pay-out cycle for the switch-out scheme.\nFor investments through systematic investment routes such as Systematic Investment Plans (SIP),\nFlex SIP, Systematic Transfer Plans (STP), Flex-STP, Swing STP, Transfer of Income Distribution\ncum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) Plan facility (TIP), etc. the units will be allotted as per the closing\nNAV of the day on which the funds are available for utilization by the Target Scheme irrespective of\nthe installment date of the SIP, STP or record date of IDCW etc.\nWhile the AMC will endeavour to deposit the payment instruments accompanying investment\napplication submitted to it with its bank expeditiously, it shall not be liable for delay in realization of\nfunds on account of factors beyond its control such as clearing / settlement cycles of the banks.\nSince different payment modes have different settlement cycles including electronic transactions\n(as per arrangements with Payment Aggregators / Banks / Exchanges etc), it may happen that the\ninvestor's account is debited, but the money is not credited within cut-off time on the same date to\nthe Scheme's bank account, leading to a gap / delay in Unit allotment. Investors are therefore\nurged to use the most efficient electronic payment modes to avoid delays in realization of funds\nand consequently in Unit allotment.\nC] For Redemption (including switch-out) applications\n● In respect of valid applications received upto 3 p.m. on a Business Day by the Fund, same\nday's closing NAV shall be applicable.\n● In respect of valid applications received after 3 p.m. on a Business Day by the Fund, the\nclosing NAV of the next Business Day shall be applicable.\nTransactions through online facilities / electronic modes:\nThe time of transaction done through various online facilities / electronic modes offered by the AMC,\nfor the purpose of determining the applicability of NAV, would be the time when the request for\npurchase / sale / switch of units is received in the servers of AMC/RTA.\nThe AMC has the right to amend cut off timings subject to SEBI (MF) Regulations for the smooth and\nefficient functioning of the Scheme.\n11. Minimum Application Amount / Number of Units\nPurchase (including switch- Additional Purchase Redemption (including\nin) (including switch-in) switch-out)\nRs. 500/- and in multiples of Rs. 500/- and in multiples of Rs. 100 and in multiples of Re.\nRs. 500 Rs. 500 thereafter. 1/- thereafter.\nthereafter.

Benchmark Index\nNIFTY 500 Index (TRI)\n14. Dividend / IDCW Policy\nIt is proposed to declare IDCW subject to availability of distributable surplus, as computed in\naccordance with SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996.\nIDCW, if declared, will be paid (subject of deduction of tax at source, if any) to those Unitholders /\nBeneficial Owners whose names appear in the Register of Unit holders maintained by the Mutual\nFund/ statement of beneficial ownership maintained by the Depositories, as applicable, under the\nIDCW option as on the Record Date. The IDCW payment shall be transferred to the Unitholders within\n7 working days of the record date of such declaration of IDCW or such other timeline as may be\nspecified by SEBI from time to time. In the event of failure to transfer IDCW within the stipulated\nperiod, the AMC shall be liable to pay interest @ 15% per annum to the Unitholders for the delay in\npayment as computed from the Record Date or from such other date or for such period as may be\nadvised by SEBI from time to time. The Trustee/ AMC reserves the right to change the record date\nfrom time to time. However, it must be distinctly understood that the actual declaration of IDCW and\nthe frequency thereof will inter alia, depend on the availability of distributable surplus as computed in\naccordance with SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. The decision of the Trustee in this regard\nshall be final.\nThere is no assurance or guarantee to unit holders as to the rate of IDCW distribution nor that IDCW\nwill be paid regularly. On payment of IDCW, the NAV will stand reduced by the amount of IDCW and\nIDCW tax (if applicable) paid.\n15.

Investment in debt securities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their\noutlook.\n13\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\nThe Scheme may also invest in the hybrid securities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for diversification and\nsubject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time.\nSubject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may engage in Stock Lending activities.\nThe Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF)\nRegulations.\nAs part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as futures and\noptions, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible in future under\napplicable regulations. However, trading in derivatives by the Scheme shall be for restricted purposes as\npermitted by the regulations.\nFor detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI. For exposure limits to derivatives, refer section ‘Where\nwill the scheme invest’ under Section II, Part II, Clause A.\nThough every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the\nAMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved.\nNo guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme.\nRisk Control\nInvestments made by the Scheme would be in accordance with the investment objectives of the scheme and\nprovisions of SEBI (MF) Regulations. Since investing requires disciplined risk management, the AMC would\nincorporate adequate safeguards for controlling risks in the portfolio construction process. The risk control\nprocess involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes that this\ndiversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use\nvarious derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time,\nwith an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest. While these measures\nare expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would\nbe completely eliminated.\nPORTFOLIO TURNOVER\nThe Scheme is an open-ended Scheme. It is expected that there would be a number of subscriptions and\nredemptions on a daily basis. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable measure of\naccuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage and\ntransaction cost.\nD. HOW WILL THE SCHEME BENCHMARK ITS PERFORMANCE?\nNIFTY 50 Hybrid Composite Debt 65:35 Index (Total Returns Index)\nAs required under clause 1.9 of Master Circular, the benchmark has been selected from amongst those\nnotified by AMFI as the first tier benchmark to be adopted by mutual funds and which are reflective of the\ncategory of the scheme.\nThis Index tracks the returns of a portfolio consisting of 65% equity and 35% debt instruments. The\nperformance will be benchmarked to the Total Returns Variant of the Index.\nThe Trustee reserves the right to change the benchmark for evaluation of performance of the Scheme from\ntime to time in conformity with the investment objectives and appropriateness of the benchmark subject to\nSEBI (MF) Regulations, and other prevailing guidelines, if any.\n14\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\nE.

OTHER DETAILS\nA. COMPUTATION OF NAV\nMethodology for Computation of NAV:\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) per Unit of the Scheme will be computed by dividing the net assets of the Scheme\nby the number of Units outstanding under the Scheme on the valuation date. The AMC will value its\ninvestments according to the valuation norms, as specified in Schedule VIII of the SEBI (MF) Regulations, or\nsuch norms as may be specified by SEBI from time to time and as stipulated in the Valuation Policy and\nProcedures of the Fund, provided in SAI available on website.\nIn case of any conflict between the Principles of Fair Valuation and valuation guidelines specified by SEBI,\nthe Principles of Fair Valuation shall prevail.\nNAV of Units under each Scheme/ Plan shall be calculated as shown below:\nMarket or Fair Value of the Scheme’s Investments\n+ Current Assets\nNAV (Rs.) - Current Liabilities and Provisions\n= _______________________________________________\nper Unit\nNo. of Units outstanding under the\nScheme/Plan\nThe NAV of the Scheme will be calculated and disclosed at the close of every Business Day.\nSeparate NAV will be calculated and announced for each of Plans/Options. The NAVs will be calculated upto\n3 decimals. Units will be allotted upto 3 decimals.\nIllustration for Computation of NAV:\nNAV for the Scheme shall be calculated as shown below:\nParticulars Amount (In INR)\nAssets\nInvestments (at Market Value) 10,000\n(Equity/Debt/Derivatives)\n20\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\nCurrent Assets\nInterest receivable 1,000\nDividend Receivables 550\nTrades Receivables 1,500\nTotal Assets (A) 13,050\nCurrent Liabilities\nTrade Payables 1,500\nExpense Payable 25\nDividend payable 25\nTotal Liabilities (B) 1,550\nNet Assets (C) (A – B) 11,500\nUnits Outstanding (D) 1,000\nNAV per unit (C/D) ₹ 11.50\nMETHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATION OF SALE AND REPURCHASE PRICE\n• Ongoing Price for subscription (purchase)/ switch-in (from other schemes/ plans of the mutual fund)\nby investors. (This is the price you need to pay for purchase/ switch-in):\nThe Sale Price for a valid purchase will be the Applicable NAV.\ni.e. Sale Price = Applicable NAV\nFor a valid purchase request of Rs. 10,000 where the applicable NAV is Rs. 11.123, the units allotted will be:\n= 10,000 (i.e. purchase amount)\n11.123 (i.e. applicable NAV)\n= 899.038 units (rounded to three decimals)\nCharges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above\nillustration.\n• Ongoing Price for redemption (sale)/ switch-outs (to other schemes/plans of the mutual fund) by\ninvestors. (This is the price you will receive for redemptions/ switch-outs):\nThe Repurchase Price for a valid repurchase will be the applicable NAV reduced by any exit load (say 1%).\ni.e. applicable NAV - (applicable NAV X applicable exit load).\nFor a valid repurchase request where the applicable NAV is Rs. 12.123, the repurchase price will be:\n= 12.123 - (12.123 X 1.00%)\n= 12.123 - 0.121\n= Rs. 12.002\nTherefore, for a repurchase of 899.038 units, the proceeds received by the investor will be -\n21\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\n= 899.038 (units) * 12.002 (Repurchase price)\n= Rs. 10,790.25 (rounded to two decimals)\nCharges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above\nillustration.\nWhile determining the price of the units, the mutual fund shall ensure that the repurchase price of an open\nended scheme is not lower than 95 per cent of the Net Asset Value.\nFor other details such as policies with respect to computation of NAV, rounding off, investment in foreign\nsecurities, procedure in case of delay in disclosure of NAV etc. refer to SAI.\nB.

Any expenditure in excess\nof the SEBI regulatory limits shall be borne by the AMC or by the Trustee or the Sponsor.\nThe mutual fund would update the current expense ratios on the website (www.hdfcfund.com) at least three\nworking days prior to the effective date of the change and update the TER under the Section titled “Statutory\nDisclosures” under sub-section titled “Total Expense Ratio of Mutual Fund Schemes”.\nIllustration: Impact of Expense Ratio on Scheme's return:\nExpense ratio, normally expressed as a percentage of Average Assets under Management, is calculated by\ndividing the permissible expenses under the Regulations by the average net assets.\nTo further illustrate in rupee terms the above, for the Scheme under reference, suppose an Investor invested\nRs. 10,000/- (after deduction of stamp duty, if any) under the Growth Option, the impact of expenses charged\nwill be as under:\nParticulars Regular Plan Direct Plan\nAmount invested at the beginning of the year (Rs.) 10,000 10,000\nReturns before expenses (Rs.) 1,500 1,500\nExpenses other than Distribution expenses (Rs.) 150 150\nDistribution expenses (Rs.) 50 0\nReturns after expenses at the end of the year (Rs.) 1300 1350\nReturns (in %) 13% 13.5%\nNote(s):\n● The purpose of the above illustration is purely to explain the impact of expense ratio charged to the Plan(s)\nunder the Scheme and should not be construed as providing any kind of investment advice or guarantee\nof returns on investments.\n● It is assumed that the expenses charged are evenly distributed throughout the year.\n● The expenses of the Direct Plan of the Scheme will be lower to the extent of the distribution expenses/\ncommission\n● Any tax impact has not been considered in the above example, in view of the individual nature of the tax\nimplications. Each investor is advised to seek appropriate advice.\nC. LOAD STRUCTURE\nExit Load is an amount which is paid by the investor to redeem the units from the scheme. Load amounts are\nvariable and are subject to change from time to time. For the current applicable structure, please refer to the\nwebsite of the AMC (www.hdfcfund.com) or you may call at 1800 3010 6767/1800 419 7676 or your\ndistributor.\nType of Load Load chargeable (as %age of NAV)\nExit Load In respect of each purchase / switch-in of Units, upto 15% of the units may be\nredeemed without any exit load from the date of allotment.

While determining the\nprice of the units, the mutual fund shall ensure that the repurchase price of an open ended scheme is not\nlower than 95 per cent of the Net Asset Value. Exit load (net of GST) charged, if any, shall be credited to the\nScheme. The investor is requested to check the prevailing load structure of the Scheme before investing.\n26\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\nSECTION II\nI. INTRODUCTION\nA. DEFINITIONS / INTERPRETATION\nVisit: https://www.hdfcfund.com/statutory-disclosure/offer-document-disclosures\nB. RISK FACTORS\n■ Scheme Specific Risk Factors:\nSome of the specific risk factors related to the Scheme include, but are not limited to the following:\n(i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments\n• Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily\nbasis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and\ninvestors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks.\n• Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a\nlarger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment\nin such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk.\n• While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these\ninvestments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the\nScheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold.\n• Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in\nthe debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances.\n(ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities\n• The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market\ninstruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme\nis expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase\nin the level of interest rates.\n• Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which may\nrestrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security\nis finally sold.\n• Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of\nthe issuers.\n• Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of\nan issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which\nmay have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in\neconomic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions\nspecific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit\nquality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will\nendeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis.\n• Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities\nbefore their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such prepayment\nmay force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields,\nresulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n• Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the\nsecurities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on\n27\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\ninterest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be\nlower than that originally assumed.\n• Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and\nsuch periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems\nin settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are\nuninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities\npurchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment\nopportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the\nabsence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in\npotential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in\nthe Scheme's portfolio.\n• Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed income\nsecurity. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest\nrates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing\ncoupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of\ninterest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels\nat which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government\nSecurities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the\nsense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by\nmovement in interest rates in the financial system.\n• Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme\nInformation Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may\nincrease or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level\nof risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are\ncomparatively less risky than AA rated bonds.\n• The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated\nsecurities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may\nincrease the absolute level of risk of the portfolio.\n• As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these\nsecurities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk.\nTherefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in\nzero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero\ncoupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic\npayment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities begin paying current\ninterest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount\ndepends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest.\nIt also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived\ncredit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than\nthe market prices of securities that pay interest periodically.\n• Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: Except for any security of an associate\nor group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a stock exchange\n(“unlisted Securities”) which in general are subject to greater price fluctuations, less liquidity and\ngreater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid\nsecondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in\nunlisted securities at a fair value.\n• Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than\nrated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer-specific developments. Such investments\ndisplay increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic\nenvironment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities\ntend to be less liquid than rated debt securities.\n28\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\n(iii) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE) rated\nsecurities\nThe risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition to the\nrisk factors associated with debt instruments.\n• Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement\nfor the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in various forms and\ncould include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter of comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity\ncould be either related or non-related to the issuer like a bank, financial institution, etc. Credit\nenhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges,\netc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by\nhypothecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables\netc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluation of the credit enhancement provider, as well as the\nissuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan\npools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer.\n• Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit\nenhancements. Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit\nenhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the liquidity in the\nmarket for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt instruments. Hence,\nlower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments\nand generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold.\n• Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength\nof the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could\nhave an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to\ninability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the\nunderlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk\nof servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore,\napart from issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit\nrisk.\n(iv) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo\nThe mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing\nCorporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri-party\nRepo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL;\nThus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments.\nThe members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the\ndefault fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in\ncase of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL).\nAs per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default\nfund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL's\ncontribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non-\ndefaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution\nbeing invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In addition, the fund contribution is\nallowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting\nmember).\nCCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to\nmeet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and the other for\nmeeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades. The mutual fund is\nexposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of\n29\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\nthe mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by CCIL, as a result\nthe scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund.\n(v) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities\nIn repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with the\nseller agreeing to buy them back at later date. The repurchase price should be greater than the original\nsale price, the difference effectively representing interest. A repo in corporate debt securities is\neconomically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer receiving corporate debt securities as collateral\nto protect against default. Some of the risks associated with repo in corporate debt are given below:\n• Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to buy\nback securities at the contracted price on the contracted date. In case of over the counter (OTC) repo\ntrades, the investment manager will endeavour to manage counterparty risk by dealing only with\ncounterparties having strong credit profiles. Also, the counter-party risk is to an extent mitigated by\ntaking collateral equivalent in value to the transaction after knocking off a minimum haircut on the\nintrinsic value of the collateral. In the event of default by the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have\nrecourse to the corporate debt securities. In case the repo transaction is executed on exchange\nplatform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may also provide settlement guarantee.\n• Collateral Risk: Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to meet\nthe repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions\nonly in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the\nrisk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit\nrating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the repo agreement\nor call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for replacement of security\nwith eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying\nsecurity than required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on\nthe underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the\nadequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by considering the daily market value &\napplying the prescribed haircut. The fund manager or the exchange can then arrange for additional\ncollateral from the counterparty, within a prespecified period. If the counterparty is not able to top-up\neither in form of cash / collateral, it would tantamount to early termination of the repo agreement, and\nthe outstanding amount can be recovered by sale of collateral.\n(vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities\n● Currency Risk:\nMoving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets\nof the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the Indian Rupee\nequivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value\nof certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee.\n● Interest Rate Risk:\nThe pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related, can differ\nsignificantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed to\ntheir interest rate cycles.\n● Credit Risk:\nInvestment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and\nprincipal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is\nsubstantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in debt instruments with\nrating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency.\n● Taxation Risk:\n30\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\nIn addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information (SAI)\nunder section “Special Consideration”, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges\nbased on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher\nlevel of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation.\nThe Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its\ninvestment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing /\nevolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All these may entail a\nhigher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting its\nNAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor.\n● Legal and Regulatory Risk:\nLegal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it.\nIf any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should\nbe enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject could differ\nmaterially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the\ninvestors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively.\n● Country Risk:\nThe Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk\nencompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect\nforeign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction\nof extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of\nthe overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of\ntrades or otherwise.\n● To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use\nderivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may\nbe stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time.\n• Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities:\nIn case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by regulatory\nbodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in permissible\nOverseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity.\n(vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives\n• The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an\nattempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products\nare specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those\nassociated with stocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the\nunderlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper\nvaluation and the inability of derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices.\n• Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as\ndisproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the\nfund manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be\npursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be\nprofitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such\nstrategies.\n• The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks\nassociated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.\n• Credit Risk:\n31\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\nThe credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations\nand is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction.\n• Market Risk:\nMarket movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives.\n• Illiquidity risk:\nThis is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack\nof liquidity in the market.\nAdditional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate Futures\n(IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract\nused to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly\nmatch the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF.\n(viii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares\n• Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of\nDividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non-cumulative\npreference shares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on preference shares in case of\ninadequate profits in any year.\n• Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we\nmay be forced to hold the instrument till maturity.\n• Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured and\nunsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus, there is significant risk of capital\nerosion in case the company goes into liquidation.\n(ix) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending\nAs with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the\nrisk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the\nagreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary.\nSuch failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities,\nthe inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible\nloss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved\nintermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity\n& loss of opportunity.\n(x) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt\nThe Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent\nthat the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive.\n• Limited Liquidity & Price Risk\nThere is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit\nthe ability of the investor to resell them.\n• Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk\nThe Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates\nrepresent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an\nobligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller,\nIssuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the\nInvestors' Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount\n32\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\navailable under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders\nmay get affected if the amount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover the\nshortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and\nsell the Asset. However, many factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or\nthe length of time required to realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which\nsuch Asset may be sold may be lower than the amount due from that Obligor.\n• Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs\nIn the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any\nCharge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs).\n• Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility\nIf the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor could\nexperience losses or delays in the payments.\n• Risk of Co-mingling\nWith respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into\nthe Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and\ndepositing the same into the Collection account especially considering that some of the collections\nmay be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be\nsegregated from other funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such\nfunds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to a potential loss.\n(xi) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI)\nPerpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile.\nSome of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital\nRegulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory guidelines for\nissuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds as per guidelines issued by RBI. The\ninstruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date. The key risks associated\nwith these instruments are highlighted below:\nKey Risk Factors:\n- Risk on coupon servicing\nBanks\nAs per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/\npayment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses\nor inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow banks to make payment of\ncoupons.\nNBFCs\nWhile NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can also be\ndeferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios.\nCorporates\nCorporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually\ncumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI.\n- Risk of write-down or conversion into equity\nBanks\nAs per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET-\n1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written down. Further,\n33\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\nAT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in\nthe event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank\nis deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds\nor a public sector capital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector\ninjection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates.\n- Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer\nBanks\nThe issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period from the\ndate of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does not exercise the\ncall on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call\nexercise date.\nNBFCs\nThe NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per the\nregulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines.\nHowever, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have to hold the instruments\nfor a period beyond the first call exercise date.\nCorporates\nThere is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the call option,\nthe Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise date.\n(xii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling\nShort-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he\nborrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and\nreturns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock\nback for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price\nand the lower purchase price). If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short\npositions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price\nincreases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio.\n(xiii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:\n● Price Risk:\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis\nowing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market\nconditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of\ninterest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures.\n● Interest Rate Risk:\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise,\nprices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n● Credit Risk:\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or\neven on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are\nlikely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled.\n● Liquidity Risk:\n34\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\nThis refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no\nassurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time\nwhen trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a\ndiscount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments for which a liquid market exists. As\nthese products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk.\n● Reinvestment Risk:\nInvestments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be\nrepatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay-outs, etc. Consequently,\nthe proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns.\n● Legal and Regulatory Risk\nThe regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs comprises\na relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators\nand courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new laws, regulations\nor standards or future amendments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole.\nFurthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way that will\nimpair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively\nor make distributions.\n(xiv) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes\n1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any\nchange in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the\nperformance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes.\n2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads.\n(xv) General Risk factors\n• Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments\nmade by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods\nand such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt\nof proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down because of\nvarious factors that affect the capital markets in general.\n• As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes\nand settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be significant in\nthe event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view\nof the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending\nredemptions) under certain circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption\nand / or Suspend Redemption of the units.\n• At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest\nin securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash\nor cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to\nsubstantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments\nin cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity requirements.\n• Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the\nportfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to medium term period.\n• Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may\ninclude changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies.\n• The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset-liability\nmismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities\nleading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments.\n35\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\nC. RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES\nRisk Mitigation measures for investments in equity / equity related and debt instruments\n• The Scheme’s portfolio comprises a judicious mix of equity and debt investments. The Scheme has the\nflexibility to vary the equity component from 65% to 80% and debt component from 20% to 35%.\n• The Scheme aims to maintain a well-diversified equity portfolio comprising stocks across various sectors\nof the economy. This shall aid in managing concentration risk and sector specific risks.\n• The Scheme targets to maintain exposure across different market cap segments - i.e. large, mid-cap and\nsmall cap. This shall aid in managing volatility and also improve liquidity. The debt and money market\ninvestments of the scheme also help in maintaining the necessary portfolio liquidity.\n• Investments in debt securities would be undertaken after assessing the associated credit risk, interest\nrate risk and liquidity risk.\n• The Scheme seeks to manage the duration of debt assets on a proactive basis to manage interest rate\nrisks and to optimise returns.\n• A credit evaluation of each debt exposure would be undertaken. This would also consider the credit\nratings given to the instrument by recognised rating agencies. Investments in debt/money market\nsecurities would normally be undertaken in instruments that have been assigned high investment grade\nratings by any of the recognised rating agencies. Unrated investments, if any, would require specific\napproval from a committee constituted for the purpose.\nCredit Evaluation Policy\nThe credit evaluation policy of the AMC entails evaluation of credit fundamentals of each investment\nopportunity. Some of the factors that are evaluated inter-alia may include outlook on the sector, parentage,\nquality of management, and overall financial strength of the credit. The AMC utilises ratings of recognized\nrating agencies as an input in the credit evaluation process. Investments in bonds and debenture are usually\nin instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by a recognized rating agency.\nIn line with clause 12.12 of Master Circular, the AMC may constitute committee(s) to approve proposals for\ninvestments in unrated instruments. The AMC Board and the Trustee shall approve the detailed parameters\nfor such investments. The details of such investments would be communicated by the AMC to the Trustee in\ntheir periodical reports. It would also be clearly mentioned in the reports, how the parameters have been\ncomplied with. However, in case any security does not fall under the parameters, the prior approval of Board\nof AMC and Trustee shall be sought.\nLiquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to sell / liquidate a security at short notice at\nprevailing market prices or without incurring impact cost. While government bonds, money market\ninstruments and shorter maturity instruments are generally easier to sell, corporate bonds and other\ninstruments typically face higher liquidity risk. Further, higher rated securities normally are more liquid\ncompared to lower rated securities. As a result, different portfolios will face different levels of liquidity risk\nbased on the underlying portfolio composition. Some of the strategies to reduce liquidity risk are creating\nportfolios that are diversified across maturities, ratings, types of securities, etc. in line with the fund\nobjectives, regulations and investment strategy.\nCredit Risk: Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities. Hence,\ncredit risk faced by different schemes will be different based on the underlying portfolio / investment\nstrategy. To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be\nundertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors\n(parentage, track record etc.). Each of the scheme/portfolio will endeavour to maintain adequate\ndiversification across issuers / sectors in line with scheme objectives, regulations and investment\nstrategy. Unrated investments, if any, would require specific approval from a committee constituted for\nthe purpose.\nDebt Derivatives Risk: The AMC has provision for using derivative instruments for portfolio balancing\nand hedging purposes. Interest Rate Swaps will be done with approved counter parties under pre\n36\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\napproved ISDA agreements. Mark to Market of swaps, netting off of cash flow and default provision\nclauses will be provided as per standard practice on a reciprocal basis. Interest Rate Swaps and other\nderivative instruments will be used as per local (RBI and SEBI) regulatory guidelines.\nInterest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk of change in the NAVs due to change in overall market\nyields. The change in value of a security, for a given change in yield, is higher for a security with higher\nduration and vice versa. Hence portfolios with higher duration will have higher volatility. The AMC shall\nstrive to actively manage the duration of the respective funds based on the prevailing market conditions\n/ outlook of interest rates, keeping in mind the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable\nregulations.\nConcentration Risk: The AMC will attempt to mitigate this risk by maintaining adequate diversification\nacross issuers/ sectors / instrument type in line with the scheme objectives, investment strategy and\napplicable regulations. This will also be managed by keeping prudent investment limits on any particular\nindustry or issuer or issuer group based on the size, credit profile, etc. to reduce issuer or industry specific\nrisk.\nRisk Mitigation measures for investments in Non-Convertible Preference Shares:\nCredit Risk - To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer\nwill be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative\nfactors (parentage, track record etc.).\nLiquidity Risk - The Fund endeavours to invest in preference shares of those companies which have\nrelatively better market acceptability amongst market participants that increases the probability of\nsecondary sale in case an exit from the investment is required.\nUnsecured in nature - The Fund endeavours to mitigate this risk by exercising due diligence while\nassessing the business, financial and management risks of the company before investing.\nRisk Mitigation factors relating to investment in Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI):\n• Risk on coupon servicing and Risk of write-down or conversion into equity\nBanks: The risks on coupon servicing or principal write down/ conversion to equity are mitigated, to a certain\nextent, if the investee bank has strong financial position and meets the required regulatory guidelines. Hence,\nan in-depth credit evaluation of each bank is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage,\nprofitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.).\nGiven the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable\nsurplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed.\nInvestment is done only in the AT-1 bonds of banks with strong credit worthiness, in our assessment. This,\nin turn, reduces the risk of its capital position falling below regulatory requirements and / or reaching PONV.\nRisk of write-down or conversion into equity is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates.\n• Risk on coupon servicing\nNBFCs\nThese risks are mitigated, to certain extent, if the investee NBFC has strong financial position and meets the\nrequired regulatory guidelines. Hence, an in-depth credit evaluation of each NBFC is undertaken, keeping in\nmind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors\n(parentage, track record etc.). Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track\n37\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\nrecord of profitability, distributable surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to\ninfuse capital, in case it is needed.\nCorporates\nTo mitigate this risk, an in-depth credit evaluation of each corporate is undertaken, keeping in mind both\nquantitative (leverage, profitability, industry position, market share etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage,\ntrack record etc.). Additionally, given that the coupon is usually cumulative in nature and the corporate is\nrestricted from paying any dividends till all previous dues are paid to the perpetual bond investor, the company\nhas adequate incentive to not defer coupon on PDIs.\n• Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer\nBanks\nWhile the issuer bank does have an option to not exercise the first call, experience suggests that all Indian\nbanks till now have exercised the call option during the call period. We believe that banks are cognizant of\nthe investor sensitivities with regards to risk of not exercising the call option at the first call date. Further, as\nwe invest in issuers with sound credit worthiness, we expect them to understand the importance of exercising\nthe call as the part of their long term capital raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of call option exercise\ncan lead to increase in cost of AT1 bonds for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond\ntenors) and impact the bank's profitability adversely. Given the importance of AT1 instruments for prudently\nmanaging the capital levels and improving the returns for the equity holders, we are of the opinion that banks\nwould choose to service the interest on AT1 bonds and exercise the first call option on AT1 bonds, as they\nhave done in the past. Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual instrument on first call date\n(say due to market disruption), the annual call on these instruments would enable the bank to call the bond\non any of the subsequent annual call options dates.\nNBFCs and Corporates\nWhile the issuer is not obligated to exercise the call option on first call date, the coupon step-up usually\nprovides financial incentive to the Issuer to exercise the call option. Further, as we invest in issuer with sound\ncredit worthiness, we expect them to be cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to exercising the\ncall as the part of their long term resource raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of first call option exercise\ncan lead to increase in cost of PDI for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond tenors)\nand impact the issuer's profitability adversely. Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual\ninstrument on first call date (say due to market disruption), the coupon step up also compensates the investor\nfor extended holding period.\nWhile these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance\nthat these risks would be completely eliminated.\nII.

The appointment of such intermediaries shall be in\naccordance with the applicable requirements of SEBI and within the permissible ceilings of expenses as\nstated under Regulation 52 of SEBI (MF) Regulations.\n• Investment in Securitised Debt\nA securitisation transaction involves sale of receivables by the originator (a bank, non-banking finance\ncompany, housing finance company, or a manufacturing/service company) to a Special Purpose Vehicle\n(SPV), typically set up in the form of a trust. Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs),\nthe proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator. In this manner, the originator, by selling\nhis loan receivables to an SPV, receives consideration from investors much before the maturity of the\nunderlying loans. Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying loans from borrowers. Typically,\nthe transaction is provided with a limited amount of credit enhancement (as stipulated by the rating agency\nfor a target rating), which provides protection to investors against defaults by the underlying borrowers.\nGenerally available asset classes for securitisation in India are:\n● Commercial vehicles\n● Auto and two wheeler pools\n● Mortgage pools (residential housing loans)\n● Personal loan, credit card and other retail loans\n● Corporate loans/receivables\nInvestment / Risk Mitigation Strategy\n1. Risk profile of securitised debt vis-à-vis risk appetite of the Scheme\nThe risk profile of securitised debt is generally at par with the risk profile of other debt securities at the\nsame level of credit rating. Securitised debt offers additional income (spread) over a debt security of\nsimilar rating and maturity, which enables the scheme to optimize its income without taking any additional\ncredit risk. Securitised debt is generally less liquid, however, investment in securitised debt is made to\n41\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\nmaintain a diversified portfolio of debt securities that optimizes return without increasing the overall risk\nprofile of the Scheme.\n2. Policy relating to originators based on nature of originator, track record, NPAs, losses in earlier\nsecuritised debt, etc\nThe originator is an entity (like banks, non-banking finance companies, corporates etc), which has initially\nprovided the loan & is also generally responsible for servicing the loans. The schemes will invest in\nsecuritised debt of originators with at least investment grade credit rating and established track record. A\ndetailed evaluation of originator is done before the investment is made in securitised debt of any originator\non various parameters given below:\n● Track record\nThe investment in securitised debt is done based on origination and underwriting process and\ncapabilities of the originator, overview of corporate structure, group to which they belong, experience\nof the company in the business & how long they have been in the business, financial condition of the\ncompany, credit rating, past performance of similar pools by the originator, etc.\n● Willingness to pay through credit enhancement facilities etc.\nCredit enhancement is provided by the originator, as indicated by rating agencies, so as to adequately\ncover the defaults and acts as a risk mitigation measure. The size of the credit enhancement as\nindicated by rating agency depends on the originator's track record, past delinquencies, pattern of the\nportfolio & characteristics of the pool vis-a-vis of the portfolio, nature of the asset class.\n● Ability to pay\nThe quality of the origination impacts the performance of the underlying asset & thus originators with\nstrong systems and processes in place can eliminate poor quality assets. A robust risk management\nsystem of the originator and availability of MIS reports on timely basis, results in creation of strong\nasset portfolio.\n● Business Risk Assessment\nThe business risk assessment of originator / underlying borrower also includes detailed credit\nassessment wherein following factors are also considered:\n- Outlook for the economy (domestic and global)\n- Outlook for the industry\n- Company specific factors\nIn addition, a detailed review and assessment of rating rationale is done along with interactions with\nthe company as well as the rating agency. All investment in securitised debt is done after taking into\naccount, the Critical Evaluation Parameters (for pool loan and single loan securitisation transactions)\nregarding the originator / underlying issuer as mentioned below:\n● Default track record/ frequent alteration of redemption conditions / covenants\n● High leverage ratios of the ultimate borrower (for single-sell downs) - both on a standalone basis\nas well on a consolidated level/ group level\n● Higher proportion of reschedulement of underlying assets of the pool or loan, as the case may be\n● Higher proportion of overdue assets of the pool or the underlying loan, as the case may be\n● Poor reputation in market\n● Insufficient track record of servicing of the pool or the loan, as the case may be.\n3. Risk mitigation strategies for investments with each kind of originator\nInvestments are based on assessment of following parameters, so as to mitigate risk associated with\nsuch investment:\na. Credit quality, size and reach of the originator\n42\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\nb. Nature of receivables/asset category i.e. cars, construction equipment, commercial vehicles, personal\nloans etc.\nc. Collection process, infrastructure and follow-up mechanism\nd. Quality of MIS\ne. Credit cum liquidity enhancement\nf. Credit appraisal norms of originator\ng. Asset Quality - portfolio delinquency levels\nh. Past performance of rated pools\ni. Pool Characteristics - seasoning, Loan-to-value ratios, geographic diversity etc.\n4. The level of diversification with respect to the underlying assets, and risk mitigation measures for\nless diversified investments\nDiversification of underlying assets is achieved through a) prudent mix of asset categories - i.e. cars (new,\nused), commercial vehicles, construction equipment, unsecured loans to individuals or small & medium\nenterprises b) total number of contracts in a pool c) average ticket size of loans and d) geographical\ndistribution.\nRisk mitigation measures for less diversified investments in pools is accomplished through the size of\ncredit enhancement, seasoning or loan to value ratios.\nIllustrative framework, which will be applied while evaluating investment decision relating to a pool\nsecuritisation transaction:\nCharacteristics/ Mortgage Commercial Car 2 Micro Personal Single Others\nType of Pool Loan Vehicle and wheelers Finance Loans Sell\nConstruction Pools Downs\nEquipment\nApproximate\n12-60 8-40\nAverage maturity (in NA 12-60 months NA NA\nmonths months\nMonths)\nCollateral margin\n(including cash,\nguarantees, excess NA 5-20% 4-15% 4-15% NA NA\ninterest spread,\nsubordinate tranche)\nAverage Loan to Refer Refer\nNA 80-95% 70-90% 70-95% NA NA\nValue Ratio Note A Note B\nAverage seasoning 3-8 2-5\nNA 3-8 months NA NA\nof the Pool months months\nMaximum single NA NA\nexposure range NA 3-7% (Retail (Retail NA NA\npool) Pool)\nAverage single\nNA 1-5% 0-1% 0-1% NA NA\nexposure range %\nNA - Not Applicable\nInformation in the table above is based on current scenario and is subject to change depending upon the\nchange in related factors.\n43\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\nNotes:\nA. In case of securitised debt with underlying being single loan, the investment limit applicable to the\nunderlying borrower is considered.\nB. Other investment will be decided on a case to case basis.\nIn case of asset backed pools (ABS), evaluation of the pool assets is done considering the following\nfactors: (Refer the table above which illustrates the averages of parameters considered while selecting\nthe pool)\n• Size of the loan\n• Average original maturity of the pool\n• Loan to Value Ratio\n• Average seasoning of the pool\n• Default rate distribution\n• Geographical Distribution\n• Credit enhancement facility\n• Liquid facility\n• Structure of the pool\n5. Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation\nThe illustrative average seasoning of the debt by originator prior to securitisation is given above in table\n(Refer Point 4).\nMinimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation in the case of asset pools is in\nthe form of seasoning of loans to various asset classes (cars, commercial vehicles, etc.) and generally\nvaries from one month to six months depending on the nature of asset.\n6. Minimum retention percentage by originator of debts to be securitised\nWhile minimum retention percentage by originator is not prescribed, any amount retained by the originator\nthrough subordination is viewed positively at the time of making investment and generally varies from 5%\nto 10%.\n7. The mechanism to tackle conflict of interest when the mutual fund invests in securitised debt of\nan originator and the originator in turn makes investments in that particular scheme of the fund\nAll proposals for investment in securitised debt are evaluated by the credit analyst based on several\nparameters such as nature of underlying asset category, pool characteristics, asset quality, credit rating\nof the securitisation transaction, and credit cum liquidity enhancement available. Investment in securitised\ndebt in any scheme is made by the respective fund manager in line with the investment objective of that\nscheme.\n8. The resources and mechanism of individual risk assessment with the AMC for monitoring\ninvestment in securitised debt (in general)\nInvestment in securitised debt is monitored regularly with regards to its performance on various\nparameters such as collection efficiency, delinquencies, prepayments and utilization of credit\nenhancement. Information on these parameters is available through monthly reports from Pool Trustees\nand through information disseminated by the rating agencies. Monthly performance report is released by\nthe credit analyst to the fund management team and the fund management team periodically reviews the\nsame.\nTrading in Derivatives\n• The Scheme may take derivatives position based on the opportunities available subject to the guidelines\nprovided by SEBI from time to time and in line with the overall investment objective of the Scheme.\n44\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\n• The Scheme intends to use derivatives mainly for the purpose of hedging and portfolio balancing. Losses\nmay arise as a result of using derivatives, but these are likely to be compensated by the gains on the\nunderlying cash instruments held by the Scheme.\n• The Scheme may take position in derivative instruments like Futures, Options, and such other derivative\ninstruments as may be permitted by SEBI from time to time.\nExposure to Derivatives\nThe exposure limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by SEBI vide its clause 12.25 of\nMaster Circular and as amended from time to time are as follows:\nPosition Limits\nThe position limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by clause 12.25 of Master circular read\nwith SEBI circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-2/P/CIR/2024/140 dated October 15, 2024 are as follows:\ni.

Long positions in index derivatives (long futures, long calls and short puts) shall not exceed (in\nnotional value) the Mutual Fund's holding of cash, government securities, T-Bills and similar\ninstruments.\niv. Position limit for Mutual Funds for stock based derivative contracts\nThe Mutual Fund position limit in a derivative contract on a particular underlying stock, i.e. stock option\ncontracts and stock futures contracts will be as follows:\nThe combined futures and options position limit shall be 20% of the applicable Market Wide Position\nLimit (MWPL).\nv. Position limit for each scheme of a Mutual Fund\nThe scheme-wise position limit requirements shall be:\n1.

This position limits shall be applicable on the combined position in all derivative contracts on an\nunderlying stock at a Stock Exchange.\n3. For index based contracts, Mutual Funds shall disclose the total open interest held by its scheme\nor all schemes put together in a particular underlying index, if such open interest equals to or\nexceeds 15% of the open interest of all derivative contracts on that underlying index.\nExposure Limits\nThe exposure limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by clauses 12.24 and 12.25\nof Master Circular, are as follows:\n1. The cumulative gross exposure through equity, debt, derivative positions (including fixed income\nderivatives), repo transactions in corporate debt securities, credit default swaps, Real Estate\nInvestment Trusts (REITs), Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs), other permitted\nsecurities/assets and such other securities/assets as may be permitted by SEBI from time to time\nshall not exceed 100% of the net assets of the scheme, subject to clause 12.24 and 12.25 of Master\nCircular.\n2. Mutual Funds shall not write options or purchase instruments with em-bedded written options.\n3. The total exposure related to option premium paid must not exceed 20% of the net assets of the\nscheme.\n4. Cash or cash equivalents i.e. Government Securities, T-Bills and Repo on Government Securities\nhaving residual maturity of less than 91 days may be treated as not creating any exposure.\n5. Exposure due to hedging positions may not be included in the above mentioned limits subject to\nthe following:\na) Hedging positions are the derivative positions that reduce possible losses on an existing\nposition in securities and till the existing position remains.\nb) Hedging positions cannot be taken for existing derivative positions. Exposure due to such\npositions shall have to be added and treated under limits mentioned in Point 1.\nc) Any derivative instrument used to hedge has the same underlying security as the existing\nposition being hedged.\nd) The quantity of underlying associated with the derivative position taken for hedging\npurposes does not exceed the quantity of the existing position against which hedge has\nbeen taken.\n6. (a) Mutual Funds may enter into plain vanilla Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) for hedging purposes. The\nvalue of the notional principal in such cases must not exceed the value of respective existing assets\nbeing hedged by the scheme.\n(b) In case of participation in IRS is through over the counter transactions, the counter party has to\nbe an entity recognized as a market maker by RBI and exposure to a single counterparty in such\ntransactions should not exceed 10% of the net assets of the scheme. However, if mutual funds are\ntransacting in IRS through an electronic trading platform offered by the Clearing Corporation of\nIndia Ltd. (CCIL) and CCIL is the central counterparty for such transactions guaranteeing\nsettlement, the single counterparty limit of 10% shall not be applicable.\n46\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\n7. Exposure due to derivative positions taken for hedging purposes in excess of the underlying\nposition against which the hedging position has been taken, shall be treated under the limits\nmentioned in point 1.\n8. Definition of Exposure in case of Derivative Positions\nEach position taken in derivatives shall have an associated exposure as defined under. Exposure\nis the maximum possible loss that may occur on a position. However, certain derivative positions\nmay theoretically have unlimited possible loss. Exposure in derivative positions shall be computed\nas follows:\nPosition Exposure\nLong Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts\nShort Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts\nOption Bought Option Premium Paid * Lot Size * Number of Contracts\nExposure limits on Credit Default Swaps (CDS)\nExposure through CDS (Notional amount of both CDS bought and sold) shall not exceed 10% of AUM\nof scheme and shall be within the overall limit of derivatives.\nExposure limits on Interest Rate Futures (IRF)\nThe exposure limits for trading in Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) by Mutual Funds specified by clause\n12.25.9 of Master Circular are as follows:\ni. To reduce interest rate risk in a debt portfolio, mutual funds may hedge the portfolio or part of the\nportfolio (including one or more securities) on weighted average modified duration basis by using\nInterest Rate Futures (IRFs). The maximum extent of short position that may be taken in IRFs to hedge\ninterest rate risk of the portfolio or part of the portfolio, is as per the formula given below:\n(Portfolio Modified Duration*\nMarket Value of the Portfolio)\n(Futures Modified Duration *Futures Price/PAR)\nii. In case the IRF used for hedging the interest rate risk has different underlying security(s) than the\nexisting position being hedged, it would result in imperfect hedging.\niii.

These instruments comprise close to 60% of all outstanding debt and more than 75% of the\ndaily trading volume on the Wholesale Debt Market Segment of the National Stock Exchange of India Limited.\nIn the money market, activity levels of the Government and Non- Government Debt vary from time to time.\nInstruments that comprise a major portion of money market activity include,\nOvernight Call\nRepo/Reverse Repo Agreements\nTri-party Repos on Government securities or treasury bills (TREPS)\nTreasury Bills\nGovernment Securities with a residual maturity of < 1 year\nCommercial Paper\nCertificates of Deposit\nBills Rediscounting Scheme\nThough not strictly classified as Money Market Instruments, PSU/ DFI / Corporate paper with a residual\nmaturity of < 1 year, are actively traded and offer a viable investment option.\nThe following table gives approximate yields prevailing during the month ended March 31, 2025 on some of\nthe instruments.

The price and yield on various\ndebt instruments fluctuate from time to time depending upon the macro economic situation, inflation rate,\noverall liquidity position, foreign exchange scenario etc. Also, the price and yield vary according to maturity\nprofile, credit risk etc.\nGenerally, for instruments issued by a non-Government entity (corporate / PSU bonds), the yield is higher\nthan the yield on a Government Security with corresponding maturity. The difference, known as credit spread,\ndepends on the credit rating of the entity.\n• Overseas Debt Market\nThe nature and number of debt instruments available in international debt markets is very wide.

Investments in rated international debt offer multiple\nbenefits of risk reduction, a much wider universe of top quality debt and also potential gains from currency\nmovements.\nInvestments in international markets are most often in U.S. dollars, though the Euro, Pound Sterling and the\nYen are also major currencies. Though this market is geographically well spread across global financial\ncentres, the markets in the U.S., European Union and London offer the most liquidity and depth of\ninstruments.\nBesides factors specific to the country / issuer, international bond prices are influenced to a large extent by\na number of other factors; chief among these are the international economic outlook, changes in interest\nrates in major economies, trading volumes in overseas markets, cross currency movements among major\ncurrencies, rating changes of countries / corporations and major political changes globally.\nThe approximate yields to maturity in the US Bond Market are as follows:\nMaturity US Treasury yields (%)\n(As at March 31, 2025)\n3 months 4.32\n6 months 4.23\n2 years 3.89\n3 years 3.89\n5 years 3.96\n10 years 4.23\nSource : H.15, Federal Reserve Statistical Release\n50\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund-SID\nMaturity US AA\nCorporate Bond yields rate* (%)\n(As at March 31, 2025)\n1 year 4.2684\n2 years 4.1517\n5 years 4.3893\n10 years 4.8634\n(Source - Bloomberg)\n* Composite curve include AA-, AA, AA+ as US AAA curve has been discontinued.\nB.

Investment Strategy\nThe investment objective of the scheme is to generate capital appreciation / income from a portfolio,\npredominantly of equity & equity related instruments. The Scheme also provides the Investment\nManager with limited flexibility to shift asset allocation between equity and debt investment. The equity\nand debt assets of the Scheme would be managed as per the respective strategies as given below:\nThe aim of equity strategy will be to build a portfolio of companies across market capitalization which\nhave:\na) reasonable growth prospects\nb) sound financial strength\nc) sustainable business models\nd) acceptable valuations that offer potential for capital appreciation.\n4\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund - KIM\nThe Scheme aims to maintain a reasonably diversified portfolio at all times.\nInvestment in Debt securities (including securitised debt) and Money Market Instruments will be as per\nthe limits in the asset allocation table of the Scheme, subject to permissible limits laid under SEBI (MF)\nRegulations. Investment in debt securities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and\ntheir outlook.\nThe Scheme may also invest in the hybrid securities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for diversification\nand subject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time.\nSubject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may engage in Stock Lending\nactivities.\nThe Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF)\nRegulations.\nAs part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as futures\nand options, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible in future\nunder applicable regulations. However, trading in derivatives by the Scheme shall be for restricted\npurposes as permitted by the regulations.\nFor detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI.\nThough every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the\nAMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be\nachieved. No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme.\n8. Risk Profile of the Scheme\nMutual Fund Units involve investment risks including the possible loss of principal. Please read the\ndetails on risk factors carefully before investment. Scheme specific Risk Factors are summarized below:\n(i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments\n• Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a\ndaily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk\nand investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks.\n• Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and\ncarry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the\nexchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk.\n• While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell\nthese investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead\nto the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold.\n• Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments\nheld in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances.\n(ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities\n• The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market\ninstruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the\nScheme is expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected\nby an increase in the level of interest rates.\n5\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund - KIM\n• Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, which\nmay restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till\nthe security is finally sold.\n• Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term\nrating of the issuers.\n• Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk\nof an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other\nissues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial conditions of an\nissuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and\npolitical conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse\nimpact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may increase the risk of the\nportfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit\nanalysis.\n• Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its\nsecurities before their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such\nprepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities\noffering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme.\n• Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from\nthe securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the\n\"interest on interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows can be\nreinvested may be lower than that originally assumed.\n• Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement\nperiods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays\nor other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the\nassets of the Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the\nScheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the\nScheme to miss certain investment opportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in\nthe Scheme's portfolio, due to the absence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for\ndebt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the Scheme in the event of a\nsubsequent decline in the value of securities held in the Scheme's portfolio.\n• Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price-risk like any other fixed income\nsecurity. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when\ninterest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the\nexisting coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The\nnew level of interest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money\nand/or the price levels at which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-\nrisk is not unique to Government Securities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However,\nGovernment Securities are unique in the sense that their credit risk generally remains zero.\nTherefore, their prices are influenced only by movement in interest rates in the financial system.\n• Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the\nScheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme\nrisk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds\ncarry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds,\nAAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated bonds.\n• The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / unrated\nsecurities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields.\nThis may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio.\n• As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security,\nthese securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default\nrisk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose\n6\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund - KIM\nto invest in zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the\nportfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder\nto any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securities\nbegin paying current interest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to\ntheir face values. The discount depends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when\nsecurities begin paying current interest. It also varies depending on the prevailing interest rates,\nliquidity of the security and the perceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero\ncoupon securities are generally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay\ninterest periodically.\n• Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: Except for any security of an\nassociate or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which are not listed on a stock\nexchange (“unlisted Securities”) which in general are subject to greater price fluctuations, less\nliquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted debt\nsecurities may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme\nwill realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value.\n• Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher\nthan rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer-specific developments. Such\ninvestments display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating\neconomic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile\nand such securities tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities.\n(iii) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE)\nrated securities\nThe risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition\nto the risk factors associated with debt instruments.\n• Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit\nenhancement for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in\nvarious forms and could include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter of comfort, etc. from\nanother entity. This entity could be either related or non-related to the issuer like a bank,\nfinancial institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form of pledge\nof shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed\nsecurities, securitized paper backed by hypothecation of car loan receivables, securities backed\nby trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluation of\nthe credit enhancement provider, as well as the issuer is undertaken to determine the issuer\nrating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan pools or securitization, etc. is assessed to\narrive at rating for the issuer.\n• Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit\nenhancements. Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due to the\ncredit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the\nliquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt\ninstruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to\nsell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when\nsuch instruments are sold.\n• Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined\nstrength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the\nstructure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in\nstructure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such\nas legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case of SO\n7\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund - KIM\ntransactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized\ndebt or assets backed transactions. Therefore, apart from issuer level credit risk such debt\ninstruments are also susceptible to structure related credit risk.\n(iv) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo\nThe mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the\nClearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities\nand in Tri-party Repo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems\nprovided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for\ntransactions in the said segments. The members are required to contribute an amount as\ncommunicated by CCIL from time to time to the default fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the\ndefault waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any member in settling\ntransactions routed through CCIL).\nAs per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the\ndefault fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization\nof CCIL's contribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions\nof the non-defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default\nfund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In addition, the\nfund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other\nclearing member (the defaulting member).\nCCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a\nview to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and the\nother for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades. The\nmutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of CCIL, in the event that\nthe contribution of the mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another\nmember by CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the\ndefault fund.\n(v) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities\nIn repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold\nwith the seller agreeing to buy them back at later date. The repurchase price should be greater\nthan the original sale price, the difference effectively representing interest. A repo in corporate\ndebt securities is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer receiving corporate debt\nsecurities as collateral to protect against default. Some of the risks associated with repo in\ncorporate debt are given below:\n• Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation\nto buy back securities at the contracted price on the contracted date. In case of over the counter\n(OTC) repo trades, the investment manager will endeavour to manage counterparty risk by\ndealing only with counterparties having strong credit profiles. Also, the counter-party risk is to an\nextent mitigated by taking collateral equivalent in value to the transaction after knocking off a\nminimum haircut on the intrinsic value of the collateral. In the event of default by the repo\ncounterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the corporate debt securities. In case the repo\n8\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund - KIM\ntransaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may also\nprovide settlement guarantee.\n• Collateral Risk: Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to\nmeet the repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo\ntransactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team.\nAdditionally, to address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security\nheld as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an\nearly termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut\nrequirement or call for replacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment\nmanager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security than required as per RBI/SEBI\nregulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To\nmitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral\ncan be monitored on a daily basis by considering the daily market value & applying the\nprescribed haircut. The fund manager or the exchange can then arrange for additional collateral\nfrom the counterparty, within a prespecified period. If the counterparty is not able to top-up\neither in form of cash / collateral, it would tantamount to early termination of the repo\nagreement, and the outstanding amount can be recovered by sale of collateral.\n(vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities\n● Currency Risk:\nMoving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the\nassets of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the Indian\nRupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes\nin the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee.\n● Interest Rate Risk:\nThe pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related, can\ndiffer significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand\nexposed to their interest rate cycles.\n● Credit Risk:\nInvestment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest\nand principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the\nissuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in\ndebt instruments with rating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating\nagency.\n● Taxation Risk:\nIn addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information\n(SAI) under section “Special Consideration”, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional\nchallenges based on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be\nsubject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation.\nThe Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its\ninvestment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing /\nevolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All these may entail\na higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting\nits NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor.\n● Legal and Regulatory Risk:\n9\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund - KIM\nLegal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely\naffect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or\nregulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may\nbe subject could differ materially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect\nthe Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed\nretrospectively.\n● Country Risk:\nThe Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk\nencompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely\naffect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as\nintroduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-lateral conflict leading to\nimmobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective\njurisdiction for execution of trades or otherwise.\n● To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may\nuse derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with\nconditions as may be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time.\n• Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities:\nIn case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme provided by\nregulatory bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in\npermissible Overseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity.\n(vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives\n• The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an\nattempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative\nproducts are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis\ndifferent from those associated with stocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an\nunderstanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks\ninclude, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate\nperfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices.\n• Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as\ndisproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of\nthe fund manager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to\nbe pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not\nalways be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify\nor execute such strategies.\n• The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the\nrisks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.\n• Credit Risk:\n• The credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its\nobligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative\ntransaction.\n• Market Risk:\nMarket movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives.\n• Illiquidity risk:\n10\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund - KIM\nThis is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due\nto lack of liquidity in the market.\nAdditional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate\nFutures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the\nIRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio\nmay not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF.\n(viii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares\n• Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment\nof Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non-cumulative\npreference shares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on preference shares in case\nof inadequate profits in any year.\n• Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and\nthus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity.\n• Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured\nand unsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus, there is significant\nrisk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation.\n(ix)Risk factors associated with Securities Lending\nAs with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including\nthe risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms\nof the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved\nintermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the\nborrower of the securities, the inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities\ndeposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from\nthe securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent\nout securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss of opportunity.\n(x) Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt\nThe Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not\nrepresent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive.\n• Limited Liquidity & Price Risk\nThere is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could\nlimit the ability of the investor to resell them.\n• Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk\nThe Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These\nCertificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not\nrepresent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any\naffiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate\nHolders against the Investors' Representative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause\ndepletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor\nPayouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit\nEnhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to\nrepay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However, many factors\n11\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund - KIM\nmay affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required to\nrealise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold\nmay be lower than the amount due from that Obligor.\n• Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs\nIn the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any\nCharge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs).\n• Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility\nIf the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor\ncould experience losses or delays in the payments.\n• Risk of Co-mingling\nWith respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors\ninto the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a\nServicer and depositing the same into the Collection account especially considering that some\nof the collections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan\nAgreements may not be segregated from other funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as\nServicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to a potential\nloss.\n(xi) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI)\nPerpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital\nprofile. Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III\nCapital Regulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory\nguidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds as per guidelines\nissued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date.\nThe key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below:\nKey Risk Factors:\n- Risk on coupon servicing\nBanks\nAs per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel\ndistributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable\nreserves and surpluses or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow\nbanks to make payment of coupons.\nNBFCs\nWhile NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can also\nbe deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital\nratios.\nCorporates\nCorporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is\nusually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of\nthe PDI.\n- Risk of write-down or conversion into equity\nBanks\n12\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund - KIM\nAs per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1\n(CET-1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written\ndown. Further, AT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the\ndiscretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point,\ndetermined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write\noff/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection happens. The write\noff/conversion has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital. This risk is not applicable in\ncase of NBFCs and Corporates.\n- Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer\nBanks\nThe issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period\nfrom the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does not\nexercise the call on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period\nbeyond the first call exercise date.\nNBFCs\nThe NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per\nthe regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI\nguidelines. However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have to\nhold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date.\nCorporates\nThere is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the call\noption, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise date.\n(xii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling\nShort-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he\nborrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted\nand returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the\nstock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher\nshort sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results\nin loss. Thus, Short positions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically\nunlimited if the price increases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio.\n(xiii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs:\n● Price Risk:\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily\nbasis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general\nmarket conditions, factors and forces affecting capital market, Real Estate and Infrastructure\nsectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures.\n● Interest Rate Risk:\nSecurities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise,\nprices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase.\n13\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund - KIM\n● Credit Risk:\nCredit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest\npayment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. Securities/ Instruments of REITs\nand InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be\npre scheduled.\n● Liquidity Risk:\nThis refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There is no\nassurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be\ntime when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may\nreflect a discount from the market price of comparable securities/instruments for which a liquid\nmarket exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk.\n● Reinvestment Risk:\nInvestments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there\ncould be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay-outs, etc.\nConsequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns.\n● Legal and Regulatory Risk\nThe regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs\ncomprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and\nenforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to\nhow any new laws, regulations or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers of\nREITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the\nregulatory system will not change in a way that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply with\nthe regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions.\n(xiv) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes\n1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any\nchange in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the\nperformance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes.\n2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads.\n(xv) General Risk factors\n• Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the\ninvestments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different\nsettlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances\nleading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme\ncan go up or down because of various factors that affect the capital markets in general.\n• As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading\nvolumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be\nsignificant in the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of\nthe Scheme. In view of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit\nredemptions (including suspending redemptions) under certain circumstances, as described under\nsection Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend Redemption of the units in the SID.\n• At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to\ninvest in securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by\nit in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments\namounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain\ncertain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity requirements.\n14\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund - KIM\n• Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between\nthe portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to medium term\nperiod.\n• Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments,\nwhich may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies.\n• The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset-liability\nmismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities\nleading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield\ninstruments.\nFor details on risk mitigation measures, please refer SID.\n9. Plans/ Options\nPlans: Regular & Direct\nRegular and Direct Plans offer the following options:\n(a) Growth Option\n(b) Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) Option - Investors should note that\ndistributions can be made out of Equalization Reserves (representing accumulated realized gains),\nwhich is part of sale price paid by them.\nThis Option offers following facilities:\n• Payout of IDCW (“Payout”) and\n• Re-investment of IDCW (“Re-investment”)\nIDCW Frequency - Under the IDCW Option, the Scheme has a Quarterly frequency for IDCW\ndistribution.\nDefault Option- Growth\nDefault Facility- Payout\nFor detailed disclosure on default plans and options, kindly refer SAI.\n10. Applicable NAV (after the scheme opens for subscriptions and redemptions)\nThe below cut-off timings and applicability of NAV shall be applicable in respect of valid applications\nreceived at the Official Point(s) of Acceptance on a Business Day:\nA] For Purchase (including switch-in) of any amount:\n● In respect of valid applications received upto 3.00 p.m. and where the funds for the entire\namount are available for utilization before the cut-off time i.e. credited to the bank account of the\nScheme before the cut-off time - the closing NAV of the day shall be applicable.\n● In respect of valid applications received after 3.00 p.m. and where the funds for the entire\namount are credited to the bank account of the Scheme either at any time on the same day or\nbefore the cut-off time of the next Business Day i.e. available for utilization before the cut-off\ntime of the next Business Day - the closing NAV of the next Business Day shall be applicable.\n● Irrespective of the time of receipt of application, where the funds for the entire amount are\ncredited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time on any subsequent Business\nDay i.e. available for utilization before the cut-off time on any subsequent Business Day - the\nclosing NAV of such subsequent Business Day shall be applicable.\nB] For Switch-ins of any amount:\nFor determining the applicable NAV, the following shall be ensured:\n15\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund - KIM\n● Application for switch-in is received before the applicable cut-off time.\n● Funds for the entire amount of subscription/purchase as per the switch-in request are credited to\nthe bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time.\n● The funds are available for utilization before the cut-off time.\n● In case of ‘switch’ transactions from one scheme to another, the allocation shall be in line with\nredemption payouts.\nIn case of switches, the request should be received on a day which is a Business Day for the\nSwitch-out scheme. Redemption for switch-out shall be processed at the applicable NAV as per\ncut-off timing. Switch-in will be processed at the Applicable NAV (on a Business Day) based on\nrealization of funds as per the redemption pay-out cycle for the switch-out scheme.\nFor investments through systematic investment routes such as Systematic Investment Plans (SIP),\nFlex SIP, Systematic Transfer Plans (STP), Flex-STP, Swing STP, Transfer of Income Distribution\ncum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) Plan facility (TIP), etc. the units will be allotted as per the closing\nNAV of the day on which the funds are available for utilization by the Target Scheme irrespective of\nthe installment date of the SIP, STP or record date of IDCW etc.\nWhile the AMC will endeavour to deposit the payment instruments accompanying investment\napplication submitted to it with its bank expeditiously, it shall not be liable for delay in realization of\nfunds on account of factors beyond its control such as clearing / settlement cycles of the banks.\nSince different payment modes have different settlement cycles including electronic transactions (as\nper arrangements with Payment Aggregators / Banks / Exchanges etc), it may happen that the\ninvestor's account is debited, but the money is not credited within cut-off time on the same date to\nthe Scheme's bank account, leading to a gap / delay in Unit allotment. Investors are therefore urged\nto use the most efficient electronic payment modes to avoid delays in realization of funds and\nconsequently in Unit allotment.\nC] For Redemption (including switch-out) applications\n● In respect of valid applications received upto 3 p.m. on a Business Day by the Fund, same day's\nclosing NAV shall be applicable.\n● In respect of valid applications received after 3 p.m. on a Business Day by the Fund, the closing\nNAV of the next Business Day shall be applicable.\nTransactions through online facilities / electronic modes:\nThe time of transaction done through various online facilities / electronic modes offered by the AMC, for\nthe purpose of determining the applicability of NAV, would be the time when the request for purchase /\nsale / switch of units is received in the servers of AMC/RTA.\nThe AMC has the right to amend cut off timings subject to SEBI (MF) Regulations for the smooth and\nefficient functioning of the Scheme.\n11. Minimum Application Amount / Number of Units\nPurchase (including switch- Additional Purchase Redemption (including\nin) (including switch-in) switch-out)\nRs.100/- and any amount Rs.100/- and any amount Rs. 100 and in multiples of Re.\nthereafter thereafter 1/- thereafter.\nNote: Allotment of units will be Note: Allotment of units will be Note: There will be no\ndone after deduction of done after deduction of minimum redemption criterion\napplicable stamp duty, if any. applicable stamp duty, if any. for Unit based redemption.\n16\nHDFC Hybrid Equity Fund - KIM\n12. Despatch of Redemption Request\nWithin 3 working days of the receipt of valid redemption request at the Official Points of Acceptance of\nHDFC Mutual Fund for this Scheme or within such timelines as may be prescribed by SEBI / AMFI from\ntime to time in case of exceptional circumstances or otherwise.\n13. Benchmark Index\nNIFTY 50 Hybrid Composite Debt 65:35 Index (Total Returns Index)\n14. Dividend / IDCW Policy\nIt is proposed to declare IDCW subject to availability of distributable surplus, as computed in\naccordance with SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996.\nIDCW, if declared, will be paid (subject of deduction of tax at source, if any) to those Unitholders /\nBeneficial Owners whose names appear in the Register of Unit holders maintained by the Mutual Fund/\nstatement of beneficial ownership maintained by the Depositories, as applicable, under the IDCW\noption as on the Record Date. The IDCW payment shall be transferred to the Unitholders within 7\nworking days of the record date of such declaration of IDCW or such other timeline as may be specified\nby SEBI from time to time. In the event of failure to transfer IDCW within the stipulated period, the AMC\nshall be liable to pay interest @ 15% per annum to the Unitholders for the delay in payment as\ncomputed from the Record Date or from such other date or for such period as may be advised by SEBI\nfrom time to time. The Trustee/ AMC reserves the right to change the record date from time to time.\nHowever, it must be distinctly understood that the actual declaration of IDCW and the frequency thereof\nwill inter alia, depend on the availability of distributable surplus as computed in accordance with SEBI\n(Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. The decision of the Trustee in this regard shall be final.\nThere is no assurance or guarantee to unit holders as to the rate of IDCW distribution nor that IDCW\nwill be paid regularly. On payment of IDCW, the NAV will stand reduced by the amount of IDCW and\nIDCW tax (if applicable) paid.\n15.

The income / gains generated from this collective investment scheme are distributed proportionately amongst the investors, after deducting applicable expenses and levies, by calculating a scheme's \"Net Asset Value\" or NAV. In return, mutual fund charges a small fee.\nIn short, mutual fund is a collective pool of money contributed by several investors and managed by a professional Fund Manager.\nMutual Funds in India are established in the form of a Trust under Indian Trust Act, 1882, in accordance with SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996.\nThe fees and expenses charged by the mutual funds to manage a scheme are regulated and are subject to the limits specified by SEBI.\nHOW A MUTUAL FUND WORKS?\nOne should avoid the temptation to review the fund's performance each time the market falls or jumps up significantly. For an actively-managed equity scheme, one must have patience and allow reasonable time - between 18 and 24 months - for the fund to generate returns in the portfolio.\nWhen you invest in a mutual fund, you are pooling your money with many other investors. Mutual fund issues \"Units\" against the amount invested at the prevailing NAV. Returns from a mutual fund may include income distributions to investors out of dividends, interest, capital gains or other income earned by the mutual fund. You can also have capital gains (or losses) if you sell the mutual fund units for more (or less) than the amount you invested.\nMutual funds are ideal for investors who –\nlack the knowledge or skill / experience of investing in stock markets directly.\nwant to grow their wealth, but do not have the inclination or time to research the stock market.\nwish to invest only small amount.\nWHY INVEST IN MUTUAL FUNDS?\nAs investment goals vary from person to person – post-retirement expenses, money for children's education or marriage, house purchase, etc. – the investment products required to achieve these goals too vary. Mutual funds provide certain distinct advantages over investing in individual securities. Mutual funds offer multiple choices for investment across equity shares, corporate bonds, government securities, and money market instruments, providing an excellent avenue for retail investors to participate and benefit from the uptrends in capital markets. The main advantages are that you can invest in a variety of securities for a relatively low cost and leave the investment decisions to a professional manager.\nHide Menu\nWhat's Covered?\nWHAT ARE MUTUAL FUNDS ?\nHOW A MUTUAL FUND WORKS?\nWHY INVEST IN MUTUAL FUNDS?\nRelated Topics\nHistory of Mutual Funds in India\nMyths & Facts About Mutual Funds\nTypes of MF Schemes\nAssociation of Mutual Funds in India\nKnow About AMFI\nAbout AMFI\nObjectives\nBoard of Directors\nAMFI Executives\nCommittees\nView More\nMedia\nPress Release\nAMFI Publications\nAMFI Mutual Fund Summit\nGallery\nVideos\nOther Links\nSchedule of Investor Awareness Program\nAMC Branches\nLocate a MF Distributor\nSEBI\nUseful Links\nView More\nTERMS OF USE\n|\nPRIVACY NOTICE\n© 2025 AMFI.

The daily NAV of a mutual fund is disclosed after deducting the expenses.\nCurrently, in India, the expense ratio is fungible, i.e., there is no limit on any particular type of allowed expense as long as the total expense ratio is within the prescribed limit. The regulatory limits of TER that can be incurred/charged to the fund by a Mutual Fund AMC have been specified under Regulation 52 of SEBI Mutual Fund Regulations.\nEffective from April 1, 2020 the TER limit has been revised as follows.\nIn addition, mutual funds have been allowed to charge up to 30 bps more, if the new inflows from retail investors from beyond top 30 cities (B30) cities are at least (a) 30% of gross new inflows in the scheme or (b) 15% of the average assets under management (year to date) of the scheme, whichever is higher. This is essentially to encourage inflows into mutual funds from tier - 2 and tier - 3 cities.\nTER has a direct bearing on a scheme’s NAV – the lower the expense ratio of a scheme, the higher the NAV\n. Thus, TER is an important parameter while selecting a mutual fund scheme.\nAs per the current SEBI Regulations, mutual funds are required to disclose the TER of all schemes on a daily basis on their websites as well as AMFI’s website.\nHide Menu\nRelated Topics\nNet Asset Value\nTrack your MF Investments using Fund Fact Sheet\nDownload Various Forms\nAssociation of Mutual Funds in India\nKnow About AMFI\nAbout AMFI\nObjectives\nBoard of Directors\nAMFI Executives\nCommittees\nView More\nMedia\nPress Release\nAMFI Publications\nAMFI Mutual Fund Summit\nGallery\nVideos\nOther Links\nSchedule of Investor Awareness Program\nAMC Branches\nLocate a MF Distributor\nSEBI\nUseful Links\nView More\nTERMS OF USE\n|\nPRIVACY NOTICE\n© 2025 AMFI.

It does this by putting a risk score on every asset class held by the mutual fund scheme. Each debt or equity instrument and other assets, such as cash, gold, and other financial instruments found in mutual fund portfolios, is assigned a particular risk value.\nIn the case of equities, each position in the portfolio is assigned a risk score based on three main factors:\nMarket Capitalization:\nSmall-cap stocks pose more risk than mid-cap stocks, which in turn are riskier than large-cap stocks. The risk value for each is updated every six months.\nVolatility:\nStocks with substantial daily price fluctuations are assigned a higher risk value. This is calculated from a stock's price behaviour over the past two years.\nImpact Cost (Liquidity)1:\nStocks with low trading volumes experience significant price shifts in large transactions. This raises the impact cost and corresponding risk value. This risk value is based on the three-month average impact cost, including the current month being evaluated.\nFor debt securities, risk assessment involves the following factors:\nCredit Risk2:\nThe risk value is lower for higher credit ratings (e.g., AAA/G-Sec/SDL/TREPS) and increases for securities with below-investment-grade ratings. This shift happens due to the rising likelihood of default in unrated and below-investment-grade securities.\nInterest-Rate Risk:\nThis risk is determined by using the Macaulay Duration of the portfolio. Bonds with longer maturity period have higher risk values due to their heightened sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates.\nLiquidity Risk3:\nLiquidity risk assessment considers factors like listing status, credit rating, and debt instrument structure.\nAdditionally,\nSEBI\nhas issued comprehensive guidelines for assigning risk values to other asset classes such as cash & net current assets, derivatives, gold, foreign securities, REITs & InvITs and more.\nThe total risk score is calculated by averaging each asset's risk value in a\nmutual fund portfolio\n.\nLastly, this risk score is used to map the fund scheme to a certain risk level (i.e. Low, Moderately Low, Moderate, Moderately High, or High) on the riskometer .\nRisk Label\nFund’s Average Risk Score\nLow\n1\nLow to Moderate\n2\nModerate\n3\nModerately High\n4\nHigh\n5\nVery High\n6 or more\nIt is important to note that the\nriskometer\nfor each mutual fund scheme is evaluated monthly. Mutual Funds/AMCs will display the updated riskometer and portfolio information on their website and the AMFI website within ten days of each month's conclusion.\n1. Impact Cost relies on how much the stock price changes when a large purchase or sale occurs.\n2. Credit risk indicates the likelihood of a borrower defaulting.\n3. Liquidity risk is a bond's ability to be sold before maturity due to market demand.\nDisclaimer\nMutual Fund investments\nare subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.\nRead More\nI Am Ready to Invest\nRelated Articles\nMore details are loading\nLoad More\nCalculators\nMore details are loading\nLoad More",

All\nmutual fund scheme documents\nhave to display the riskometer upfront and clearly so that investors know the risk associated with that particular fund.\nThe riskometer classifies risk into six distinct levels. These include Low, Low to Moderate, Moderate, Moderately High, High and Very High. Refer to the provided illustration on the left side.\nLow Risk:\nThe funds that fall under this category have the least risk due to their underlying securities, making them suitable for individuals seeking capital protection to some extent.\nLow to Moderate Risk:\nThese are for investors willing to take a bit of risk to get some returns over a medium to long time. Most ultra-short duration funds fall under this category.\nModerate Risk:\nThis is ideal for investors who aim to expand their portfolio taking some risks. Most dynamic bond funds fall under this category.\nModerately High Risk:\nThese funds hold a somewhat higher level of risk and might suit investors with a slightly higher risk profile. These are for investors willing to accept some uncertainty and greater volatility in exchange for the prospect of achieving higher growth or profitability.\nHigh Risk:\nFunds in this category mainly invest in equities. They are ideal for those willing to take on high risk for prospective gains.\nVery High Risk:\nThey are extremely risky funds that invest in volatile stocks or overseas mutual fund units. They’re for investors who are likely to invest in high-risk, high-reward investment opportunities.\nDisclaimer\nMutual Fund investments\nare subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.\nRead More\nI Am Ready to Invest\nRelated Articles\nMore details are loading\nLoad More\nCalculators\nMore details are loading\nLoad More",

INTRODUCTION\nA. RISK FACTORS\nStandard Risk Factors\n• Investment in Mutual Fund units involves investment risks such as trading volumes, settlement risk,\nliquidity risk, default risk including the possible loss of principal.\n• As the price / value / interest rates of the securities in which the Scheme/Plan invests fluctuate, the value of\nyour investment in the Scheme/Plan may go up or down.\n• Past performance of the Sponsors / AMC / Mutual Fund does not guarantee future performance of the\nScheme/Plan.\n• UTI Retirement Benefit Pension Fund - Wealth Maximiser Scheme/Plan or UTI Retirement Benefit\nPension Fund - Income Generator Scheme/Plan does not in any manner indicate either the quality of the\nScheme/Plan or its future prospects and returns.\n• The sponsors are not responsible or liable for any loss resulting from the operation of the Scheme/Plan\nbeyond the initial contribution of Rs.10,000/- made by them towards setting up the Fund.\n• The present Scheme/Plan is not a guaranteed or assured return Scheme/Plan.\n• Statements / Observations made are subject to the laws of the land as they exist at any relevant point of\ntime. Growth, appreciation, dividend and income, if any, referred to in this Scheme/Plan Information\nDocument are subject to the tax laws and other fiscal enactments as they exist from time to time. The\nNAVs of the Scheme/Plan may be affected by changes in the general market conditions, factors and forces\naffecting capital market, in particular, level of interest rates, various markets related factors and trading\nvolumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures.\n• The Scheme/Plan is not guaranteeing or assuring any dividend. The Scheme/Plan is also not assuring that it\nwill make periodical dividend distributions, though it has every intention of doing so. All dividend\ndistributions are subject to the availability of distributable surplus of the Scheme/Plan.\nScheme/Plan Specific Risk Factors\nRisk associated with investment in Equities and Equity related instruments\nThe Scheme/Plan’s investment in Equity and Equity related instruments are exposed to following risks:\n• Price Risk : Stock prices may rise or decline based on a number of factors. These could be a combination\nof company-specific and system-specific factors. Their impact on different types of stocks may vary. Prices\nchange due to events that impact entire financial markets or industries (for example, changes in inflation,\nconsumer demand, supply situation and GDP growth). Company specific factors may include the likes of\nsuccess or failure of a new product, mergers, takeovers, earnings announcement and changes in\nmanagement, to name a few. Securities owned by the Scheme may offer opportunities for growth because\nof high potential earnings growth; they may also involve greater risks than securities that do not have the\nsame potential.\n• Stock Market Volatility : Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse\nissuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Different parts of the market can react\ndifferently to these developments. The stock-specific volatility may also change over a period of time as\nthe characteristic of the stock undergoes a change in terms of market cap category.\n6\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\n• Liquidity Risk : Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of\nthe equity and equity related investments made by the Scheme/Plan which could cause the Scheme/Plan to\nmiss certain investment opportunities. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different\nsettlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to\ndelays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The inability of the Scheme/Plan to make intended\nsecurities purchases due to settlement problems could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment\nopportunities.\nSecurities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger\namount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on exchanges or offer other exit options\nto the investor, including a put option. Within the regulatory limits, the Scheme/Plan may choose to invest\nin unlisted securities that offer attractive yields. this may however increase the risk of the portfolio.\nInvestments in equity and equity related securities involve high degree of risks and investors should not\ninvest in the Scheme/Plan unless they have the capacity to take the risk of losing their investment.\n• Dependency Risk : The scheme may invest in stocks and mutual funds and exchange-traded funds linked\nto stocks. Equity confers a proportionate share of the ownership of a company. Its value will depend on the\nsuccess of the company’s business, income paid to stockholders by way of dividend, the value of the\ncompany’s assets, quality of its corporate governance practice, its attractiveness relative to peers and\ngeneral market conditions. The scheme may also invest in convertible securities and warrants. Convertible\nsecurities generally are fixed income securities or preference shares that may be converted into common\nstock after a prescribed period.\n• Temporary Investment Risk : If the fund manager is of the view that market or economic conditions may\nbecome unfavourable for investors in equities, he may invest a higher proportion of the fund’s assets in\nshort-term and medium-term fixed income instruments as well as near cash equivalents. This may be a\ndefensive and temporary strategy. The fund manager may also adopt such a strategy while zeroing in on\nappropriate investment opportunities or to maintain liquidity. At times, such investments may lead to lower\nreturns. In these circumstances, the Scheme may be unable to achieve its investment goal.\n• Non - Diversification Risk : The scheme may pursue only a limited degree of diversification. It may invest\na greater proportion of assets in the securities of one issuer (within the limit permitted by regulation) as\ncompared to a diversified fund. This could have implications for the performance of the scheme. The\nScheme may be more sensitive to economic, business, political or other changes and this may lead to\nsizeable fluctuation in the Net Asset Value of the Scheme.\n• Asset - Class Risk : Stocks have historically outpaced other asset classes such as gold, fixed deposits and\nbonds, to name a few, over the long term in India. Individual stocks prices may, however, tend to rise and\ndecline in a dramatic manner. Such price movement may be due to company-specific aspects or factors\nsuch as inflation, interest rates and growth rates that affect the securities market in entirety. A slowdown in\ngrowth or a partial or full-blown recession may have a negative impact on prices of most stocks owned by\nthe Scheme.\nRisks Associated With Investments in Debt Securities and Money Market Instruments\nThe investment in debt securities money market instruments are exposed to following risks :\n• Credit Risk : Bonds/Debentures as well as other money market instruments issued by the corporate run the\nrisk of down grading by the rating agencies and even default as the worst case. Securities issued by\nCentral/State governments have lesser to zero probability of credit/default risk in view of the sovereign\nstatus of the issuer. For example: One notch downgrade of a AAA rated issuer to AA+ will have an adverse\nimpact on the price of the security and vice-versa for an upgrade of a AA+ issuer.\n• Interest Rate Risk : Bonds/ Central Government securities which are fixed income securities, run price-\nrisk like any other fixed income security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income\n7\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nsecurities fall and when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The level of interest rates is determined by\nthe rates at which government raises new money through RBI and the price levels at which the market is\nalready dealing in existing securities, rate of inflation etc. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a\nfunction of the prevailing coupon rate, number of days to maturity of a security and the increase or\ndecrease in the level of interest rates. The prices of Bonds/Central Government securities are also\ninfluenced by the liquidity in the financial system and/or the open market operations (OMO) by RBI.\nPressure on exchange rate of the Rupee may also affect security prices. Such rise and fall in price of\nbonds/central government securities in the portfolio of the schemes may influence the NAVs of the\nschemes as and when such changes occur. For a fixed term scheme, where the maturity of the debt\nsecurities in the portfolio are in line with the maturity period of the respective schemes, the interest rate risk\nmay not be there, if the investment is held upto maturity.\n• Price Risk : As long as the scheme will be invested, their Net Asset Value (NAV) is exposed to market\nfluctuations, and their value can go up as well as down. The portfolio of fixed-income securities that the\nScheme invest in would be exposed to price changes on a day-to-day basis. These price changes may occur\ndue to instrument-specific factors as well as general macroeconomic conditions. In general, price of fixed-\nincome securities go up when interest rates fall, and vice versa.\n• Liquidity or Marketability Risk : The Indian debt market is such that a large percentage of the total\ntraded volumes on particular days might be concentrated in a few securities. Traded volumes for particular\nsecurities differ significantly on a daily basis. Consequently, the schemes might have to incur a significant\n“impact cost” while transacting large volumes in a particular security. A lower level of liquidity affecting\nan individual security (ies) or an entire market may have an adverse bearing on the value of the Scheme’s\nasset. This may more importantly affect its ability to sell particular securities with minimal impact cost as\nand when necessary to meet requirement of liquidity or to sell stocks in response to triggers such as a\nspecific economic/corporate event. Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may\nrestrict the liquidity of a few of the investments.\n• Risks related to duration : Fixed Income securities of any issuer that has higher duration could be more\nrisky in terms of price movements relative to those with lower duration. Thus any impact of interest rate\nchanges would be higher on securities with higher duration irrespective of the status of the issuer of the\nsecurity.\n• Non - diversification Risk : The scheme may pursue a reasonable degree of diversification adhering to the\nSEBI guidelines on limits for investments in a single sector, limits on investments in securities issued by a\nsingle issuer etc. It may invest a greater proportion of assets in the securities of one issuer / single sector\n(within the limit permitted by regulation) as compared to a diversified fund. This could have implications\nfor the performance of the Scheme. The Scheme may be more sensitive to economic, business, political or\nother changes and this may lead to sizeable fluctuation in the Net Asset Value of the Scheme.\n• Re-investment Risk : The investments made by the Scheme/Plans is subject to reinvestment risk. This risk\nrefers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the securities in the Scheme/Plans are\nreinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the “interest on interest” component. The risk is\nthat the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed.\n• Risk from zero coupon securities: The Scheme/Plan may invest in high yield Zero coupon securities for\nmaximisation of returns. The risk of the Scheme/Plan portfolio may increase to the extent of the exposure\nin Zero coupon securities. As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder\nof the security, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, the interest rate\nrisk of zero coupon securities is higher.\nRisk associated with Investments in Repo of Corporate Debt Securities\nIn repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with the seller\nagreeing to buy them back at later date. The difference between the repurchase price and the original sale\nprice represents the interest earned. A repo is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer\n8\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nreceiving corporate debt securities as collateral to protect against default. The Scheme/Plan will be exposed\nto following risk in case, if the Scheme/Plan proposes to invest in repo of corporate debt securities:\n• Counterparty Risk: This refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to buy back securities at\nthe contracted price. The Scheme/Plan will endeavor to manage counterparty risk by dealing only with\ncounterparties having strong credit profiles assessed through in-house credit analysis or with entities\nregulated by SEBI/RBI/IRDA\nCollateral Risk: In the event of default by the repo counterparty, the Scheme/Plans have recourse to the\ncorporate debt securities. Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to meet\nthe repo obligations. This risk is mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in AA and\nabove rated money market and corporate debt securities. In addition, appropriate haircuts are applied on the\nmarket value of the underlying securities to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying\ninstrument.\nRisk associated with Investments in Debt & Equity Derivatives\n• Valuation Risk : The risk in valuing the Debt & Equity derivative products due to inadequate trading data\nwith good volumes. Derivatives with longer duration would have higher risk viz a viz the shorter duration\nderivatives.\n• Mark to Market Risk : The day-to-day potential for an investor to experience losses from fluctuations in\nunderlying stock prices and derivatives prices.\n• Systematic Risk : The risk inherent in the capital market due to macro economic factors like Inflation,\nGDP, Global events.\n• Liquidity Risk : The risk stemming from the lack of availability of derivatives products across different\nmaturities and with different risk appetite.\n• Implied Volatility : The estimated volatility of an underlying security’s price and derivatives price.\n• Interest Rate Risk : The risk stemming from the movement of Interest rates in adverse direction. As with\nall the debt securities, changes in the interest rates will affect the valuation of the portfolios.\n• Credit Risk : The risk that the counterparty will default on its obligations in a derivative transaction is\nrelatively low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts. This risk is substantially mitigated where\nderivative transactions happen through clearing corporation.\n• System Risk : The risk arising due to failure of operational processes followed by the exchanges and OTC\nparticipants for the derivatives trading.\nRisk attached with the use of Derivatives\n• Interest Rate Swaps (IRSs) and Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) do also have inherent credit and\nsettlement risks. However, these risks are substantially less, as they are limited to the interest stream and\nnot the notional principal amount.\n• In an attempt to maximize returns and protect the value of portfolio and of the investors the Scheme/Plan\nmay have an exposure into derivative products. As and when the Scheme/Plan trades in the derivatives\nmarket there are risk factors and issues concerning the use of derivatives that investors should understand.\nDerivative products are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis\ndifferent from those associated with stocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding\nnot only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Derivatives require the maintenance of\nadequate controls to monitor the transactions entered into, the ability to assess the risk that a derivative\nadds to the portfolio and the ability to forecast price or interest rate movements correctly. There is a\n9\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\npossibility that a loss may be sustained by the portfolio as a result of the failure of another party (usually\nreferred to as the “counterparty”) to comply with the terms of the derivatives contract. Other risks in using\nderivatives include the risk of mispricing or improper valuation of derivatives and the inability of\nderivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices.\n• Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as\ndisproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund\nmanager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the\nfund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No\nassurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies.\n• The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks\nassociated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.\nRisk Analysis on underlying asset classes in Securitisation\nSecuritisation – Features & Investment Strategy\nAsset securitisation is a process whereby commercial or consumer credits are packaged and sold in the\nform of financial instruments. A typical process of asset securitisation involves sale of specific Receivables\nto a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) set up in the form of a trust or a company. The SPV in turn issues\nfinancial instruments (e.g., promissory notes, pass through certificates or other debt instruments) to\ninvestors, such instruments evidencing the beneficial ownership of the investors in the Receivables. The\nfinancial instruments are rated by an independent credit rating agency. An Investor’s Agent is normally\nappointed for providing trusteeship services for the transaction.\nThe Scheme/Plan shall predominantly invest only in those securitisation issuances, which have AAA rating\nindicating the highest level of safety from credit risk point of view at the time of making an investment.\nGenerally available Asset Classes for securitisation in India are:\n(i) Commercial Vehicles\n(ii) Auto and Two wheeler pools\n(iii) Mortgage pools (residential housing loans)\n(iv) Personal Loan, credit card and other retail loans\n(v) Corporate loans / receivables\nThe Scheme/Plan may invest in various type of securitisation issuances as given above, including but not\nlimited to Asset Backed Securitisation, Mortgage Backed Securitisation, Personal Loan Backed\nSecuritisation, Collateralized Loan Obligation/Collateralized Bond Obligation and so on.\nRisk associated with investments in Securitised Papers\nTypes of Securitised Debt vary and carry different levels and types of risks. Credit Risk on Securitised\nBonds depends upon the Originator and varies depending on whether they are issued with Recourse to\nOriginator or otherwise. A structure with Recourse will have a lower Credit Risk than a structure without\nRecourse. Underlying assets in Securitised Debt may assume different forms and the general types of\nreceivables include Auto Finance, Credit Cards, Home Loans or any such receipts, Credit risks relating to\nthese types of receivables depend upon various factors including macro economic factors of these\nindustries and economies. Specific factors like nature and adequacy of property mortgaged against these\nborrowings, nature of loan agreement / mortgage deed in case of Home Loan, adequacy of documentation\nin case of Auto Finance and Home Loans, capacity of borrower to meet its obligation on borrowings in\ncase of Credit Cards and intentions of the borrower influence the risks relating to the asset borrowings\nunderlying the securitised debt.\nHolders of the securitised assets may have low credit risk with diversified retail base on underlying assets\nespecially when securitised assets are created by high credit rated tranches, risk profiles of Planned\nAmortisation Class tranches (PAC), Principal Only Class Tranches (PO) and Interest Only class tranches\n10\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\n(IO) will differ depending upon the interest rate movement and speed of prepayment. Various types of\nmajor risks pertaining to Securitised Paper are as below:\n• Liquidity & Price risk : Presently, secondary market for securitised papers is not very liquid. This could\nlimit the ability of the investor to resell them. Even if a secondary market develops and sales were to take\nplace, these secondary transactions may be at a discount to the initial issue price due to changes in the\ninterest rate structure.\n• Delinquency and Credit Risk : Securitised transactions are normally backed by pool of receivables and\ncredit enhancement as stipulated by the rating agency, which differ from issue to issue. The Credit\nEnhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates represent an\nundivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and there is no obligation of either the Issuer or\nthe Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial\nrecourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors’ Representative. Delinquencies and\ncredit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the\nInvestor Payouts may get affected if the amount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough\nto cover the shortfall. On persistent default of a Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess\nand sell the underlying Asset. However many factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such\nAsset or the length of time required to realize the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at\nwhich such Asset may be sold may be lower than the amount due from that Obligor.\n• Prepayment Risk : Asset securitisation is a process whereby commercial or consumer credits are\npackaged and sold in the form of financial instruments. Full prepayment of underlying loan contract may\nduring the tenure of the paper. In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor\nand reinvestment risk.\nRisks associated with Securities Lending\nAs with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the risk\nof failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the\nagreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary.\nSuch failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities,\nthe inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible\nloss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved\nintermediary.\nRisks associated with investing in Foreign Securities\nThe Fund may invest in overseas debt / equities / ADR’s / GDR’s with the approval of RBI/SEBI, subject\nto such guidelines as may be issued by RBI/SEBI. The net assets, distributions and income of the\nscheme/plan may be affected adversely by fluctuations in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to\nthe Indian Rupee to the extent of investments in these securities. Repatriation of such investment may also\nbe affected by changes in the regulatory and political environments. The scheme/plan’s NAV may also be\naffected by a fluctuation in the general and specific level of interest rates internationally, or the change in\nthe credit profiles of the issuers.\nThe Fund may, where necessary, appoint advisor(s) for providing advisory services for such Scheme/plan’s\ninvestments. The appointment of such advisor(s) shall be in accordance with the applicable requirements of\nSEBI. The fees and expenses would illustratively include, besides the investment management fees,\ncustody fees and costs, transaction costs and overseas regulatory costs, the fees of appointed advisor(s).\nThe fees related to these services would be borne by the AMC and would not be charged to the\nScheme/plan.\n11\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nRisk factor associated with Overseas Investment:\nSubject to necessary approvals and within the investment objectives of the Scheme/plan, the Scheme/plan\nmay invest in overseas markets which carry a risk on account of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates,\nnature of securities market of the country concerned, repatriation of capital due to exchange controls and\npolitical circumstances.\n• To the extent that the assets of the scheme/plans will be invested in securities denominated in foreign\ncurrencies, the Indian rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely\naffected by changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian rupee (if Indian rupee\nappreciates against these foreign currencies). The repatriation of capital to India may also be hampered by\nchanges in regulations concerning exchange controls or political circumstances as well as the application to\nit of other restrictions on investment. The scheme/plan may have to pay applicable taxes on gains from\nsuch investment.\n• As regards foreign equity securities that are traded on exchanges that are not located in India basis of\nvaluation will depend on the time zone of the respective country. For exchanges located in countries, with\ntime zone earlier than India, the NAV will be calculated based on the closing price of the foreign equity\nsecurity and the prevailing exchange rate on that date. For exchanges located in countries, with time zone\nlater than India, the NAV will be calculated based on the closing price of the foreign equity security and the\nprevailing exchange rate of the previous date.\n• Subject to the Regulations, the investments may be in securities which are listed or unlisted, secured or\nunsecured, rated or unrated, and acquired through secondary market purchases, RBI auctions, open market\nsales conducted by RBI etc., Initial Public Offers (IPOs), other public offers, placements, rights, offers,\nnegotiated deals, etc\n• To avoid duplication of portfolios and to reduce expenses, the Scheme/Plan may invest in any other\nScheme/Plans of the Fund to the extent permitted by the Regulations. In such an event, AMC will not\ncharge management fees on the amounts of the Scheme/Plans so invested, unless permitted by the\nRegulations.\n• Additional Risk Factors : The risk associated with underlying stocks remain the same except for the\nadditional risk of fluctuation in the exchange rate of the Indian Rupee vis-à- vis US Dollar – the currency in\nwhich GDRs / ADRs are denominated. To manage risks associated with the portfolio, foreign currency and\ninterest rate exposure, the Fund may use / invest in derivatives for efficient portfolio management including\nhedging and in accordance with the conditions as may be stipulated by SEBI / RBI. The Fund also hereby\navers that offshore investments shall be made subject to any / all approvals, as well as the conditions\nthereof as may be stipulated by SEBI / RBI and provided such investments do not result in expenses to the\nfund in excess of the ceiling, if any, on the expenses prescribed by SEBI. The expenses to the fund shall be\nlimited to the level which, in the opinion of the Fund, is reasonable and consistent with the costs and\nexpenses attendant to international investing. The Fund may, where necessary, appoint other intermediaries\nof repute such as advisors, sub-managers, sub-custodian etc. for managing and administering such\ninvestments. The appointment of such intermediaries shall be in accordance with the applicable\nrequirements of SEBI and within the permissible ceilings of expenses. The fees and expenses would\nillustratively include, besides the investment management fee, custody fees and costs, fees of appointed\noverseas advisors and sub-managers, transaction costs, and overseas regulatory costs.\n• The NAV of the Scheme/Plan to the extent invested in Debt and Money market securities are likely to be\naffected by changes in the prevailing rates of interest and are likely to affect the value of the Scheme/Plan’s\nholdings and thus the value of the Scheme/Plan’s Units.\n• The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated/ unrated\nsecurities offering higher yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio.\n12\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\n• Securities which are not quoted on the stock exchanges are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger\namount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges or offer other exit\noptions to the investor, including a put option. The AMC may choose to invest in unlisted securities that\noffer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio.\n• While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these\ninvestments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges. Money market securities,\nwhile fairly liquid, lack a well-developed secondary market, which may restrict the selling ability of the\nScheme/Plan and may lead to the Scheme/Plan incurring losses till the security is finally sold.\n• Investment decisions made by the AMC may not always be profitable, even though it is intended to\ngenerate capital appreciation and maximize the returns by actively investing in equity and equity related\nsecurities.\nOther Scheme/Plan Specific Risk factors & Risk Mitigation Measures\n• The liquidity of the Scheme/Plan’s investments may be inherently restricted by trading volumes, settlement\nperiods and transfer procedures. In the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests, or of\na re-structuring of the Scheme/Plan’s investment portfolio, these periods may become significant. Please\nread the Sections of this Scheme/Plan Information Document entitled “Special Considerations” and\n“Right to Limit Redemptions” there under.\n• Although, the objective of the Fund is to generate optimal returns, the objective may or may not be\nachieved. The investors may note that if the AMC/Investment Manager is not able to make right decision\nregarding the timing of increasing exposure in debt securities in times of falling equity market, it may result\nin negative returns. Given the nature of Scheme/Plan, the portfolio turnover ratio may be on the higher side\ncommensurate with the investment decisions and Asset Allocation of the Scheme/Plan. At times, such\nchurning of portfolio may lead to losses due to subsequent negative or unfavorable market movements.\n• As redemption is allowed only after a Lock-in- Period of five years, the investor will not be able to take\nadvantage of the opportune moments, if any, during the Lock-in-Period.\n• Post necessary approval from CBDT, the tax benefits which shall be available under the Scheme/Plan will\nbe as per the present taxation laws and will be available only to certain specified categories of investors and\nthat is subject to fulfillment of the relevant conditions. The information given is included for general\npurposes only and is based on advise that the AMC has received regarding the law and the practice that is\ncurrently in force in India and the investors and the Unit Holders should be aware that the relevant fiscal\nrules and their interpretation may change. As is the case with any investment, there can be no guarantee\nthat the tax position or the proposed tax position prevailing at the time of investment in the Scheme/Plan\nwill endure indefinitely. In view of the individual nature of tax consequences, each Investor/Unit Holder is\nadvised to consult his/her own professional tax advisor.\nRisk Mitigation Measures:\nInterest Rate Risk / Reinvestment Risk: The Scheme would manage the interest rate risk & reinvestment\nrisk by adequately matching the duration of assets in line with the duration of the Scheme.\nCredit Risk: Scheme would predominantly invest in highly rated securities where there is an internal\ncredit comfort which would reduce the probability of credit risk.\nPortfolio Quality Risk: A pre approved universe of stocks / issuers based on fundamental research is\nmaintained to which helps to mitigate the risk of a poor portfolio quality.\nConcentration Risk: The Scheme would have modest presence of issuers with reasonable limits to\ndiversify the portfolio which would mitigate the credit concentration risk as well as sector /stock specific\nconcentration risk.\n13\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nLiquidity Risk: Periodical review of the liquidity position of each scrip (Market capitalization, average\nvolume in the market vis. a vis. Portfolio Holding) to minimize liquidity risk.\nPortfolio Risk: By monitoring the return deviation and adequately managing all the above risks namely\ninterest rate risk, reinvestment risk & credit cum concentration risk the Scheme would mitigate the overall\nportfolio risk. Diversification of portfolio will also help to minimize interest rate risk, liquidity risk,\nportfolio quality risk and overall risks associated with the portfolio.\nInvestments in Equity and equity related instruments, carry various risks such as inability to sell securities,\ntrading volumes and settlement periods, market risk, liquidity risk, default risk, reinvestment risk etc.\nWhilst such risks cannot be eliminated, they may be mitigated by diversification and investing in well\nresearched stocks/equity instruments. In order to mitigate the various risks, the portfolio of the Scheme will\nbe constructed in accordance with the investment restriction specified under the Regulations which would\nhelp in mitigating certain risks relating to investments in securities market. The diversification of the\nportfolio into instruments which are well researched by a robust research team under a strong internal\nprocess would be instrumental in mitigating the risks associated.\nFurther, the AMC has necessary framework in place for risk mitigation at an enterprise level. The Risk\nManagement division is an independent division within the organization. Internal limits are defined and\njudiciously monitored. Risk indicators on various parameters are computed and are monitored on a regular\nbasis. There is a Board level Committee, the Risk Management Committee of the Board, which enables a\ndedicated focus on risk factors and the relevant risk mitigates.\nB. REQUIREMENT OF MINIMUM INVESTORS IN THE SCHEME/PLAN\nThe Scheme/Plan shall have a minimum of 20 investors and no single investor shall account for more than\n25% of the corpus of the Scheme/Plan. The two conditions shall also be complied within each calendar\nquarter, on an average basis, as specified by SEBI. If there is a breach of the 25% limit by any investor over\nthe quarter, a rebalancing period of one month would be allowed and thereafter the investor who is in\nbreach of the rule shall be given 15 days notice to redeem his exposure over the 25% limit. Failure on the\npart of the said investor to redeem his exposure over the 25% limit within the aforesaid 15 days would lead\nto automatic redemption by the Mutual Fund on the applicable Net Asset Value on the 15th day of the\nnotice period. The Fund shall adhere to the requirements prescribed by SEBI from time to time in this\nregard.\nC. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n• Right to limit Purchase of units and/or Right to limit Redemption of units\nThe AMC may, in the general interest of the Unit holders of the Scheme under this Scheme Information\nDocument and keeping in view the unforeseen circumstances / unusual market conditions, limit the total\nnumber of Units which may be redeemed on any Business Day to 5% of the total number of Units then\nissued and outstanding under any Scheme / Plan or such other percentage as the AMC may determine.\nThe AMC may, at its sole discretion in response to unforeseen circumstances or unusual market conditions\nincluding, but not limited to, extreme volatility of the stock, fixed income and money markets, extended\nsuspension of trading on the stock exchanges, natural calamities, communication breakdowns, internal\nsystem breakdowns, strikes, bandhs, riots or other situations where the AMC, considers that such\nsuspension is necessary, limit the total number of Units which may be redeemed on any Business Day to\n5% of the total number of Units then in issue or such higher percentage as the AMC may determine in any\nparticular case.\nAny Units, which by virtue of these limitations are not redeemed on a particular Business Day, will be\ncarried forward for redemption to the next Business Day, in the order of receipt. Redemptions so carried\nforward will be priced on the basis of the Redemption Price of the Business Day on which redemption is\nmade.

Debt market in India\n(i) Debt Instrument Characteristics:\nA Debt Instrument is basically an obligation which the borrower has to service periodically and generally\nhas the following features:\nFace Value : Stated value of the paper / Principal Amount\nCoupon : Zero, fixed or floating\nFrequency : Semi-annual, annual, sometimes quarterly\nMaturity : Bullet, staggered\nRedemption : FV, premium or discount\nOptions : Call/Put\nIssue Price : Par (FV) or premium or discount\nA debt instrument comprises of a unique series of cash flows for each paper, terms of which are decided at\nthe time of issue. Discounting these cash flows to the present value at various applicable discount rates\n(market rates) provides the market price.\n(ii) Debt Market Structure\nThe Indian Debt market comprises of the Money Market and the Long Term Debt Market.\nMoney market instruments are Commercial Papers (CPs), Certificates of Deposit (CDs), Treasury bills\n(T-bills), Repos, Inter-bank Call money deposit, CBLOs etc. They are mostly discounted instruments that\nare issued at a discount to face value.\nMoney market instruments have a tenor of less than one year while debt market instruments typically\nhave a tenor of more than one year\nLong Term Debt market in India comprises mainly of two segments viz., the Government securities\nmarket and the corporate securities market.\nGovernment securities includes central, state and local issues. The main instruments in this market are\nDated securities (Fixed or Floating) and Treasury bills (Discounted Papers). The Central Government\nsecurities are generally issued through auctions on the basis of ‘Uniform price’ method or ‘Multiple price’\nmethod while State Govt. are through on-tap sales.\nCorporate debt segment on the other hand includes bonds/debentures issued by private corporates, public\nsector units (PSUs) and development financial institutions (DFIs). The debentures are rated by a rating\nagency and based on the feedback from the market, the issue is priced accordingly. The bonds issued may\nbe fixed or floating. The floating rate debt market has emerged as an active market in the rising interest\nrate scenario. Benchmarks range from Overnight rates or Treasury benchmarks.\nDebt derivatives market comprises mainly of Interest Rate Swaps linked to Overnight benchmarks called\nMIBOR (Mumbai Inter Bank Offered Rate) and is an active market. Banks and corporate are major\nplayers here and of late Mutual Funds have also started hedging their exposures through these products.\nSecuritised Debt Instruments – Asset securitization is a process of transfer of risk whereby commercial\nor consumer receivables are pooled packaged and sold in the form of financial instruments. A typical\nprocess of asset securitisation involves sale of specific Receivables to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) set\nup in the form of a trust or a company. The SPV in turn issues financial instruments to investors, which\nare rated by an independent credit rating agency. Bank, Corporates, Housing and Finance companies\ngenerally issue securitised instruments. The underlying receivables generally comprise of loans of\nCommercial Vehicles, Auto and Two wheeler pools, Mortgage pools (residential housing loans), Personal\n22\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nLoan, credit card and Corporate receivables. The instrument, which is issued, includes loans or receivables\nmaturing only after all receivables are realized. However depending on timing of underlying receivables,\nthe average tenure of the securitized paper gives a better indication of the maturity of the instrument.\n(iii) Regulators\nThe RBI operates both as the monetary authority and the debt manager to the government. In its role as\na monetary authority, the RBI participates in the market through open-market operations as well as\nthrough Liquidity Adjustment facility (LAF) to regulate the money supply. It also regulates the bank\nrate and repo rate, and uses these rates as indirect tools for its monetary policy. The RBI as the debt\nmanager issues the securities at the cheapest possible rate. The SEBI regulates the debt instruments\nlisted on the stock exchanges.\n(iv) Market Participants\nGiven the large size of the trades, the debt market has remained predominantly a wholesale market.\nPrimary Dealers\nPrimary dealers (PDs) act as underwriters in the primary market, and as market makers in the secondary\nmarket.\nBrokers\nBrokers bring together counterparties and negotiate terms of the trade.\nInvestors\nBanks, Insurance Companies, Mutual Funds are important players in the debt market. Other players are\nTrusts, Provident and pension funds.\n(v) Types of security issuance and eligible investors:\nIssuer Instruments Yields (as on Maturity Investors\n03.02.2016)\nCentral Dated Securities 7.25% - 8.28% 1-30 years Banks, Insurance Co, PFs,\nGovernment MFs, PDs, Individuals, FPI\nCentral T-Bills 7.25% - 7.30% 364/91 days Banks, Insurance Co, PFs,\nGovernment MFs, PDs, Individuals, FPI\nState Dated Securities 8.40% - 8.45% 10 years Banks, Insurance Co, PFs,\nGovernment MFs, PDs, Individuals\nPSUs Corporates Bonds 8.25% - 8.48% 5-10 years Banks, Insurance Co, PFs,\nMFs, PDs, Individuals, FPI\nCorporates Bonds 8.80% - 8.60% 1-10 years Banks, MFs, Corporates,\n(AAA rated) Individuals, FPI\nCorporates Commercial 8.00% - 9.00% 15 days to 1 yr Banks, MFs, Fin Inst,\nPapers Corporates, Individuals, FPIs\nBanks Certificates of 7.40% - 8.15% 15 days to 1 yr Banks, Insurance Co, PFs,\nDeposit MFs, PDs, Individuals\nBanks Bonds 8.40% - 8.50% 10-15 years Banks, Companies, MFs, PDs,\nIndividuals\n(vi) Trading Mechanism\nGovernment Securities and Money Market Instruments\nCurrently, Government Securities (G-Sec) trades are predominantly routed though NDS-OM which is a\nscreen based anonymous order matching systems for secondary market trading in G Sec owned by RBI.\nCorporate Debt is basically a phone driven market where deals are concluded verbally over recorded\nlines.

Participation in Repo in Corporate Debt Securities\nThe Scheme/Plans shall participate in repo transactions in Corporate Debt Securities within the\nfollowing overall framework, as per the guidelines of Securities and Exchange Board of India and\nBoards of UTI Trustee Co P Ltd & UTI AMC Ltd.\n(A) Gross Exposure Norms\n(i) The gross exposure of any Scheme/Plan to ‘corporate bonds repo transactions’ shall not be more than\n10% of the net assets of the concerned Scheme/Plan.\n(ii) The cumulative gross exposure through ‘corporate bonds repo transactions’ along with equity,\ndebt and derivatives shall not exceed 100% of the net assets of the concerned Scheme/Plan.\n(iii) In addition to investment restrictions specified in SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations 1996, the\ncounter-party exposure in a Scheme/Plan, considering the investments held in the debt securities and\nvalue of collaterals held through repo transactions (as a lender), shall not be more than 30% in case of\nmoney market instruments (20% in other cases).\n(B) Category of the counter-party to be considered for making investment\nAll entities eligible for transaction in corporate debt repos, as defined by Reserve Bank of India\n(RBI) and SEBI, shall be considered for repo transactions.\n25\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\n(C) Credit Rating of Counterparty to be considered for making investment\nThe Scheme/Plan/s shall carry out repo transactions with only those counterparties, who have a\ncredit rating of ‘AA- and above’ (Long term rating) or ‘A1+’ (Short term rating).\n(D) Tenor of Repo\nAs a repo seller, the Scheme/Plan/s can borrow for a period not more than six months as per the\nexisting Regulation 44(2) of the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996.\nAs a repo buyer, the Scheme/Plan/s can lend for a maximum period of one year, subject to\nprovision/s of the Scheme/Plan Information Document (SID).\n(E) Tenor and Credit Rating of the Collateral\nThe Scheme/Plan/s shall participate in repo transactions in Corporate Rs. Bonds rated ‘AA’ and\nabove (‘A1+’ in respect of money market instruments).\nThe tenor of the collateral shall not be more than 10 years.\n(F) Minimum Haircut\nIn terms of RBI guidelines, repo transactions shall be subject to the following minimum haircuts:-\nRating of the Security AAA AA+ AA\nMinimum Haircut 7.50% 8.50% 10%\nThe above are minimum stipulated haircuts where the repo period is overnight or where the re-\nmargining frequency (in case of longer tenor repos) is daily. In all other cases, Fund Manager may\nadopt appropriate higher haircuts.\nDepending on the market conditions and risk perceptions, the Fund Manager may seek higher haircut\n(while lending) or give a higher haircut (while borrowing).\n(G) Risk factors and mitigation measures\n1) Illiquidity Risk\nThe repo market for corporate debt securities is over the counter (OTC) and illiquid. Hence, repo\nobligations cannot be easily sold to other parties.\nTherefore, to mitigate such risks, it has been stipulated that gross exposure to Repo in corporate bonds\nwould be limited to 10% of net assets of the concerned Scheme/Plan. Further, the tenor of repo would\nbe taken based on nature and unit holders’ pattern of the Scheme/Plan.\n2) Counter-party risk\nCredit risk would arise if the counter-party fails to repurchase the security as contracted or if\ncounterparty fails to return the security or interest received on due date. To mitigate such risks, the\nScheme/Plans shall carry out repo transactions with only those counterparties, which has a credit\nrating of ‘A1+’ or ‘AA- and above’. In case of lending of funds as a repo buyer, minimum haircuts on\nthe value of the collateral security have been stipulated, and we would receive the collateral security in\nthe Scheme/Plan’s account before the money is lent to the counter-party. Overall, we would have a\nlimited number of counter-parties, primarily comprising of Mutual Funds, Scheduled Commercial\nbanks, Financial Institutions and Primary dealers.\n26\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nSimilarly, in the event of the Scheme/Plan being unable to pay back the money to the counterparty as\ncontracted, the counter-party may hurriedly dispose of the assets (as they have sufficient margin) and\nthe net proceeds may be refunded to the Scheme/Plan. Thus, the Scheme/Plan may suffer losses in\nsuch cases. Sufficient funds flow management systems are in place to mitigate such risks.\n3) Collateral Risk (as a repo buyer)\nCollateral risks arise due to fall in the value of the security (change in credit rating and/or interest\nrates) against which the money has been lent under the repo arrangement. To mitigate such risks, we\nhave stipulated the minimum credit rating of the issuer of collateral security (‘AA’ for long-term\ninstruments / A1+ for money market instruments), maximum duration of the collateral security (10\nyears) and minimum haircuts on the value of the security. For further details refer to SAI/Addendum\nNo.7/2014-15 dated 7th July 2014.\n3. Participation in Derivative Products\nThe Scheme(s)/ Plan(s) may take derivatives position based on the opportunities available subject to\nthe guidelines provided by SEBI from time to time and in line with the overall investment objective of\nthe Scheme/Plan. The Scheme/Plan will comply with the prescribed disclosure requirements.\nDerivative Positions may be taken to hedge the portfolio, rebalance the same or to undertake any other\nstrategy as permitted under SEBI (MF) Regulations from time to time. Hedging does not mean\nmaximisation of returns but only reduction of systematic or market risk inherent in the investment.\nDerivatives:\nA derivative instrument, broadly, is a financial contract whose payoff structure is determined by the\nvalue of an underlying security, index, interest rate etc. Thus a derivative instrument derives its value\nfrom some underlying variable.\nDerivatives are further classified into\n• Futures\n• Options\n• Interest Rate Swaps\n• Forward Rate Agreements\nFutures:\nA futures contract is a standardized contract between two parties where one of the parties commits to\nsell, and the other to buy, a stipulated quantity of a security at an agreed price on or before a given date\nin future.\nOptions:\nAn option is a derivative instrument which gives its holder (buyer) the right but not the obligation to\nbuy or sell the underlying security at the contracted price on or before the specified date. The purchase\nof an option requires an up-front payment (premium) to the seller of the option.\nThere are two basic types of options, call option and put option.\n(a) Call option:\nA call option gives the buyer of the option the right but not the obligation to buy a given quantity of\nthe underlying asset, at a given price (strike price), on or before a given future date.\n(b) Put option:\nA put option gives the buyer of the option the right but not the obligation to sell a given quantity of\nthe underlying asset, at a given price (strike price), on or before a given future date.\n27\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nOn expiry of a call option, if the market price of the underlying asset is lower than the strike price\nthe call would expire unexercised. Likewise, if, on the expiry of a put option, the market price of\nthe underlying asset is higher than that of the strike price the put option will expire unexercised.\nThe buyer/holder of an option can make loss of not more than the option premium paid to the\nseller/writer but the possible gain is unlimited. On the other hand, the option seller/writer’s\nmaximum gain is limited to the option premium charged by him from the buyer/ holder but can\nmake unlimited loss.\nInterest Rate Swaps:\nAll swaps are financial contracts, which involve exchange (swap) of a set of payments owned by one\nparty for another set of payments owned by another party, usually through an intermediary (market\nmaker). An IRS can be defined as a contract between two parties (Counter Parties) to exchange, on\nparticular dates in the future, one series of cash flows, (fixed interest) for another series of cashflows\n(variable or floating interest) in the same currency and on the same principal for an agreed period of\ntime. The exchange of cashflows need not occur on the same date. It may be noted that in such hedged\npositions (fixed v/s floating or vice versa), both legs of the transactions have interest rate volatility as\nunderlying. Debt derivatives are as of now customised over the counter products and there is no\nguarantee that these products will be available on tap. The provision for trading in derivatives is an\nenabling provision and it is not binding on the Scheme/Plan’s to undertake trading on a day to day\nbasis.\nForward Rate Agreement (FRA) :\nA FRA is an agreement between two counter parties to pay or to receive the difference between an\nagreed fixed rate (the FRA rate) and the interest rate prevailing on a stipulated future date, based on a\nnotional amount, for an agreed period. In short, in a FRA, interest rate is fixed now for a future period.\nThe special feature of FRAs is that the only payment is the difference between the FRA rate and the\nReference rate and hence are single settlement contracts. As in the case of IRS, notional amounts are\nnot exchanged.\nDerivatives can be traded over the exchange or can be structured between two counter-parties. Those\ntransacted over the exchange are called Exchange Traded derivatives whereas the other category is\nreferred to as OTC (Over the Counter) derivatives.\nSome of the differences of these two derivative categories are as under :\nExchange traded derivatives : These are quoted on the exchanges like any other traded asset class.\nThe most common amongst these are the Index Futures, Index Options, Stock Futures and Options on\nindividual equities / securities. The basic form of the futures contract is similar to that of the forward\ncontract, a futures contract obligates its owner to purchase a specified asset at a specified exercise\nprice on the contract maturity date. Futures are cash-settled and are traded only in organised\nexchanges. Exchange traded derivatives are standardised in terms of amount and delivery date.\nStandardisation and transparency generally ensures a liquid market together with narrower spreads. On\nthe other hand, for delivery dates far in the future, there may be insufficient liquidity in the futures\nmarket whereas an OTC price may be available.\nOTC derivatives : OTC derivatives require the two parties engaging in a derivatives transaction to\ncome together through a process of negotiation. It is a derivative that is customised in terms of\nstructure, amount, tenor, underlying assets, collateral etc. Some of the common examples are interest\nrate and currency swaps, Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) etc.\nPosition Limit in Derivatives\nThe position limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by SEBI vide SEBI Circular\nNo. DNPD/Cir-29/2005 dated September 14, 2005, SEBI Circular No. DNPD/Cir -30/2006 dated\n28\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nJanuary 20, 2006 and SEBI Circular No. SEBI/DNPD/Cir-31/2006 dated September 22, 2006 are as\nfollows:\ni) Position limit for Mutual Funds in index options contracts\na. The Mutual Fund position limit in all index options contracts on a particular underlying index shall\nbe Rs. 500 crores or 15% of the total open interest of the market in index options, whichever is\nhigher, per Stock Exchange.\nb. This limit would be applicable on open positions in all options contracts on a particular underlying\nindex.\nii) Position limit for Mutual Funds in index futures contracts\na. The Mutual Fund position limit in all index futures contracts on a particular underlying index shall\nbe Rs. 500 crore or 15% of the total open interest of the market in index futures, whichever is\nhigher, per Stock Exchange.\nb. This limit would be applicable on open positions in all futures contracts on a particular underlying.\n(iii) Additional position limit for hedging\nIn addition to the position limits at point (i) and (ii) above, Mutual Funds may take exposure in\nequity index derivatives\nsubject to the following limits :\na. Short positions in index derivatives (short futures, short calls and long puts) shall not exceed (in\nnotional value) the Mutual Fund's holding of stocks.\nb. Long positions in index derivatives (long futures, long calls and short puts) shall not exceed (in\nnotional value) the Mutual Fund's holding of cash, government securities, T-Bills and similar\ninstruments.\n(iv) Position limit for Mutual Funds for stock based derivative contracts\nThe Mutual Fund position limit in a derivative contract on a particular underlying stock, i.e. stock\noption contracts and stock futures contracts will be as follows :-\na. For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit (MWPL) of Rs. 500 crores or more, the\ncombined futures and options position limit shall be 20% of applicable MWPL or Rs. 300 crores,\nwhichever is lower and within which stock futures position cannot exceed 10% of applicable\nMWPL or Rs. 150 crores, whichever is lower.\nb. For stocks having applicable market-wide position limit (MWPL) less than Rs. 500 crores, the\ncombined futures and options position limit would be 20% of applicable MWPL and futures\nposition cannot exceed 20% of applicable MWPL or Rs. 50 crore whichever is lower.\n(v) Position limit for each scheme of a Mutual Fund\nThe scheme-wise position limit requirements shall be :\na. For stock option and stock futures contracts, the gross open position across all derivative contracts\non a particular underlying stock of a scheme of a mutual fund shall not exceed the higher of:\n1% of the free float market capitalization (in terms of number of shares). or\n5% of the open interest in the derivative contracts on a particular underlying stock (in terms of\nnumber of contracts).\n29\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nb. This position limits shall be applicable on the combined position in all derivative contracts on an\nunderlying stock at a Stock Exchange.\nc. For index based contracts, Mutual Funds shall disclose the total open interest held by its scheme or\nall schemes put together in a particular underlying index, if such open interest\nequals to or exceeds 15% of the open interest of all derivative contracts on that underlying index.\nSome of the derivative techniques/ strategies that may be used are:-\n(i) The Scheme/Plan will use hedging techniques including dealing in derivative products - like futures\nand options, warrants, interest rate swaps (IRS), forward rate agreement (FRA) as may be permissible\nunder SEBI (MFs) Regulations.\n(ii) The Scheme/Plan intends to use derivatives only for the purpose of hedging and/or re-balancing of the\nportfolio against any anticipated move in the equity and debt markets. A hedge is primarily designed\nto offset a loss on a portfolio with a gain in the hedge position.\n(iii) The Fund manager may use various strategies for trading in derivatives with a view to enhancing\nreturns and taking cover against possible fluctuations in the market. One of the strategies could be to\nuse index futures with a view to increasing/ decreasing the overall level of investment in equities.\n(iv) The Fund Manager may sell the index forward by taking a short position in index futures to save on\nthe cost of outflow of funds or in the event of negative view on the market.\n(v) The Schemes/Plans shall have a maximum derivatives net position of 25% of the portfolio, i.e. net\nassets, including cash. Within this, the restriction on asset allocation would apply to derivatives\nposition as well. This means that the maximum permissible derivatives position would be split in the\nsame ratio as the asset allocation specified in the Scheme/Plan Information Document.\nAs per the current norms of UTI AMC, the value of derivative contracts outstanding at any point of\ntime will be limited to 25% of the net assets of the Scheme/Plan at the time of investment. UTI AMC\nmay in future revise the limits within the SEBI (MFs) Regulations in keeping with the investment\nobjective of the Scheme/Plan. Such derivative position will comply with overall limits and norms of\nSEBI Circular No Cir / IMD / DF / 11 / 2010 dated August 18, 2010, DNPD/CIR-29/2005 dated\nSeptember 14, 2005, SEBI/DNPD/Cir-31/2006 dated September 22, 2006 and DNPD/CIR-31/2006\ndated January 20, 2006.\n4. Exposure limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds as per SEBI Circular No.\nCir/IMD/DF/11/2010 dated 18th August 2010:\na. The cumulative gross exposure through equity, debt and derivative positions should not exceed 100%\nof the net assets of the Scheme/Plan.\nb. Mutual Funds shall not write options or purchase instruments with embedded written options.\nc. The total exposure related to option premium paid must not exceed 20% of the net assets of the\nScheme/Plan.\nd. Cash or cash equivalents with residual maturity of less than 91 days may be treated as not creating any\nexposure.\ne. Exposure due to hedging positions may not be included in the above mentioned limits subject to the\nfollowing:-\n(i) Hedging positions are the derivative positions that reduce possible losses on an existing position in\nsecurities and till the existing position remains.\n30\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\n(ii) Hedging positions cannot be taken for existing derivative positions. Exposure due to such\npositions shall have to be added and treated under limits mentioned in Point a.\n(iii) Any derivative instrument used to hedge has the same underlying security as the existing position\nbeing hedged.\n(iv) The quantity of underlying associated with the derivative position taken for hedging purposes does\nnot exceed the quantity of the existing position against which hedge has been taken.\nf. Mutual Funds may enter into plain vanilla interest rate swaps for hedging purposes. The counter party\nin such transactions has to be an entity recognized as a market maker by RBI. Further, the value of the\nnotional principal in such cases must not exceed the value of respective existing assets being hedged\nby the Scheme/Plan. Exposure to a single counterparty in such transactions should not exceed 10% of\nthe net assets of the Scheme/Plan.\ng. Exposure due to derivative positions taken for hedging purposes in excess of the underlying position\nagainst which the hedging position has been taken, shall be treated under the limits mentioned in point\na.\nDefinition of Exposure in case of Derivative Positions\nEach position taken in derivatives shall have an associated exposure as defined under. Exposure is the\nmaximum possible loss that may occur on a position. However, certain derivative positions may\ntheoretically have unlimited possible loss. Exposure in derivative positions shall be computed as\nfollows:\nPosition Exposure\nLong Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts\nShort Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts\nOption bought Option Premium Paid * Lot Size * Number of Contracts.\nThe proceeds collected during the NFO shall be used only on or after the closure of the NFO\nperiod.\nThe AMC retains the right to enter into such derivative transactions as may be permitted by the\nRegulations from time to time. For risks associated with investments in derivatives investors are\nrequested to refer to Risk Factors of this Scheme/Plan Information Document.\n5. Investment by these Schemes in any other Schemes of UTI AMC\nInvestment by these in other Mutual Fund schemes will be in accordance with Regulation 44(1),\nSeventh Schedule of the SEBI (MFs) Regulations as under: A scheme may invest in another scheme\nunder the same asset management company or any other mutual fund without charging any fees,\nprovided that aggregate inter scheme investment made by all schemes under the same management or\nin schemes under the management of any other asset management company shall not exceed 5% of the\nnet asset value of the mutual fund. Such investment will be consistent with the investment objective of\nthe schemes. No investment management fees will be charged by the AMC on such investment.\nE. WHAT ARE THE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES?\n1. UTI Retirement Benefit Pension Fund - Wealth Maximiser Scheme/Plan\nThe Wealth Maximiser Scheme/Plan, under normal market conditions, will invest in net assets primarily\nin Equity and equity related instruments and balance in fixed income securities, money market instruments\nand cash equivalents.\n31\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nFor investments primarily in equity and equity related securities, the Wealth Creation Scheme would aim\nto provide long term capital growth by investing in a well diversified portfolio of equity and equity related\nsecurities.\nThe portfolio manager proposes to invest in equity and equity related instruments of companies with\ngreater emphasis on individual company metrics driven by in-depth research techniques and employing\nthe full potential of the research team at the AMC.\nThe overlying investment philosophy would be a combination of top down and bottom up approach\nwherein the objective is to identify and invest in companies that exhibit strong and sustainable growth and\nare valued at prices which are at a discount or in short do not reflect the growth potential.\n2. UTI Retirement Benefit Pension Fund - Income Generator Scheme/Plan\nThe Income Generator Scheme, under normal market conditions, will invest in net assets primarily in Debt\nand Money market instruments. The Scheme will retain the flexibility to invest across all the debt and\nmoney market instruments of various maturities. The AMC will strive to assess risk of the potential\ninvestment in terms of credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The AMC would manage the\ninvestments of the Scheme on a dynamic basis to exploit emerging opportunities in the investment\nuniverse and manage risks at all points in time. The AMC will also invest the net assets of the Scheme in\nEquity and Equity related instruments. This Scheme seeks to generate steady long term returns with\nrelatively low levels of risk.\nPortfolio Turnover Policy (for the above mentioned both the Schemes)\nPortfolio Turnover is defined as the least of purchase or sales as a percentage of average size of a fund\nduring any specified period of time. As sales and purchases of securities can be made on daily basis, it\nwould be difficult to estimate with reasonable level of accuracy the likely turnover in portfolios. There\ncould be instances of churning of portfolio to take advantage of trading opportunity existing in the market.\nBut it would be difficult to set the target for the portfolio turnover as it would be a function of purchases,\ngeneral market conditions, trading opportunities, creation of liquidity to meet income distribution etc. The\nportfolio turnover shall be targeted so as to have return maximization for the Unit Holders. At the same\ntime, expenses such as brokerage and transaction cost shall be kept at low level so that it does not affect\nthe earnings of the Scheme/Plan.\nF. FUNDAMENTAL ATTRIBUTES\nFollowing are the Fundamental Attributes of the Scheme/Plan, in terms of Regulation 18(15A) of the\nSEBI (MF) Regulations:\n(i) Type of Scheme/Plan\nUTI-Retirement Benefit Pension Fund – Wealth Maximiser Scheme/Plan and UTI-Retirement Benefit\nPension Fund – Income Generator Scheme/Plan are an open ended notified tax savings cum pension\nScheme/Plan with no assured returns.\n(ii) Investment objective\nMain Objective - as given in Clause II B\nInvestment pattern- The tentative Equity/Debt/Money Market portfolio break-up with minimum and\nmaximum asset allocation, while retaining the option to alter the asset allocation for a short term period on\ndefensive considerations – as given in Clause II C (1)\n32\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\n(iii) Terms of issue\n• Liquidity provision of redemption: Only provisions relating to redemption as given in the SID.\n• Aggregate Expense and Fees [as given in clause IV (A) (2) to (3)] charged to the Scheme/Plan.\nIn accordance with Regulation 18(15A) of the SEBI (MF) Regulations, the Trustee shall ensure that no\nchange in the fundamental attributes of the Scheme/Plan(s) and the Plan(s) / Option(s) there under or the\ntrust or fees and expenses payable or any other change which would modify the Scheme/Plan(s) and\nPlan(s) / Option(s) there under and affect the interest of the Unit Holders, is carried out unless -\n(i) A written communication about the proposed change is sent to each unit holder and an advertisement\nis given in one English daily newspaper having nationwide circulation as well as in a newspaper\npublished in the language of the region where the Head Office of the Mutual Fund is situated; and\n(ii) The unit holders are given an option for a period of 30 days to exit at the prevailing Net Asset Value\nwithout any exit load.\nG. HOW WILL THE SCHEME/PLAN BENCHMARK ITS PERFORMANCE ?\nScheme/Plan Benchmark Index & Justification\nWealth Maximiser Scheme/Plan: S&P BSE 100 Index. Considering the\ninvestment in the fund made in equity /equity\nrelated securities with the objective of\nachieving long term wealth creation, we\npropose S&P BSE 100 Index as a benchmark\nsince majority of the stocks relate to the broader\ninvestment philosophy of the fund which is to\ninvest in stocks with potential for future growth\nand good track record.\nIncome Generator Scheme/Plan: CRISIL MIP Blended Index. Considering the\ninvestment of the fund predominantly in Debt\nand Money market securities and balance in\nequity and equity related instruments, we\npropose CRISIL MIP Blended Index as a\nbenchmark since it comprises of NIFTY and\nComposite Bond fund index, which covers\ninstruments across all maturities and credit\nrating in which Scheme/Plan is expected to\ninvest.\nThe Trustee reserves the right to change the benchmark for evaluation of performance of the Scheme from\ntime to time in conformity with the investment objectives and appropriateness of the benchmark subject to\nSEBI Regulations, and other prevailing guidelines, if any.\n33\nUTI-RBP - WMP and IGP SID\nH.

Settlement periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges. The inability of a mutual fund to sell securities held in the portfolio could result in potential losses to the scheme, should there be a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in the scheme portfolio and may thus lead to the fund incurring losses till the security is finally sold.\nEvent Risk:\nPrice risk due to company or sector specific event.\nRisks Associated with investment in Debt Securities and Money Market Instruments\nDebt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer’s inability to meet principal and interest payments on the obligation (Credit Risk) on the due date(s) and may also be subject to price volatility due to such factors as interest rate sensitivity, market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (Market Risk).\nThe timing of transactions in debt obligations, which will often depend on the timing of the Purchases and Redemptions in the Scheme, may result in capital appreciation or depreciation because the value of debt obligations generally varies inversely with the prevailing interest rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nMarket value of fixed income securities is generally inversely related to interest rate movement. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of existing fixed income securities fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase. Accordingly, value of a scheme portfolio may fall if the market interest rate rise and may appreciate when the market interest rate comes down. The extent of fall or rise in the prices depends upon the coupon and maturity of the security. It also depends upon the yield level at which the security is being traded.\nCredit Risk\nThis is risk associated with default on interest and /or principal amounts by issuers of fixed income securities. In case of a default, scheme may not fully receive the due amounts and NAV of the scheme may fall to the extent of default. Even when there is no default, the price of a security may change with expected changes in the credit rating of the issuer. It may be mentioned here that a government security is a sovereign security and is safer. Corporate bonds carry a higher amount of credit risk than government securities. Within corporate bonds also there are different levels of safety and a bond rated higher by a rating agency is safer than a bond rated lower by the same rating agency.\nSpread Risk\nCredit spreads on corporate bonds may change with varying market conditions. Market value of debt securities in portfolio may depreciate if the credit spreads widen and vice versa. Similarly, in case of floating rate securities, if the spreads over the benchmark security / index widen, then the value of such securities may depreciate.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk refers to the ease with which securities can be sold at or near its valuation yield-to-maturity (YTM) or true value. Liquidity condition in market varies from time to time. The liquidity of a bond may change, depending on market conditions leading to changes in the liquidity premium attached to the price of the bond. In an environment of tight liquidity, necessity to sell securities may have higher than usual impact cost. Further, liquidity of any particular security in portfolio may lessen depending on market condition, requiring higher discount at the time of selling.\nThe primary measure of liquidity risk is the spread between the bid price and the offer price quoted by a dealer. Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of some of these investments. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods, and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Further, delays in settlement could result in temporary periods when a portion of the assets of the Scheme are not invested and no return is earned thereon or the Scheme may miss attractive investment opportunities.\nAt the time of selling the security, the security may become illiquid, leading to loss in value of the portfolio. The purchase price and subsequent valuation of restricted and illiquid securities may reflect a discount, which may be significant, from the market price of comparable securities for which a liquid market exists.\nCounterparty Risk\nThis is the risk of failure of the counterparty to a transaction to deliver securities against consideration received or to pay consideration against securities delivered, in full or in part or as per the agreed specification. There could be losses to the fund in case of a counterparty default.\nPrepayment Risk\nThis arises when the borrower pays off the loan sooner than the due date. This may result in a change in the yield and tenor for the mutual fund scheme. When interest rates decline, borrowers tend to pay off high interest loans with money borrowed at a lower interest rate, which shortens the average maturity of Asset-backed securities (ABS). However, there is some prepayment risk even if interest rates rise, such as when an owner pays off a mortgage when the house is sold or an auto loan is paid off when the car is sold. Since prepayment risk increases when interest rates decline, this also introduces reinvestment risk, which is the risk that the principal may only be reinvested at a lower rate.\nRe-investment Risk\nInvestments in fixed income securities carry re-investment risk as the interest rates prevailing on the coupon payment or maturity dates may differ from the original coupon of the bond (the purchase yield of the security). This may result in final realized yield to be lower than that expected at the time\nThe additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on interest\" component. There may be a risk that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested are lower than that originally assumed.\nHide Menu\nWhat's Covered?\nSTANDARD RISK FACTORS\nSPECIFIC RISK FACTORS\nRisks associated with investments in Equities\nRisks Associated with investment in Debt Securities and Money Market Instruments\nRelated Topics\nMyths & Facts About Mutual Funds\nAdvantages of Investing in MF\nHow to invest in Mutual Funds\nAssociation of Mutual Funds in India\nKnow About AMFI\nAbout AMFI\nObjectives\nBoard of Directors\nAMFI Executives\nCommittees\nView More\nMedia\nPress Release\nAMFI Publications\nAMFI Mutual Fund Summit\nGallery\nVideos\nOther Links\nSchedule of Investor Awareness Program\nAMC Branches\nLocate a MF Distributor\nSEBI\nUseful Links\nView More\nTERMS OF USE\n|\nPRIVACY NOTICE\n© 2025 AMFI.

Equity funds may focus on certain sectors of the market or may have a specific investment style, such as investing in value or growth stocks.\nEquity Fund Categories as per SEBI guidelines on Categorization and Rationalization of schemes\nSector Specific Funds\nSectoral funds invest in a particular sector of the economy such as infrastructure, banking, technology or pharmaceuticals etc.\n– Since these funds focus on just one sector of the economy, they limit diversification, and are thus riskier.\n– Timing of investment into such funds are important, because the performance of the sectors tend to be cyclical.\nExamples of Sector Specific Funds - Equity Mutual Funds with an investment objective to invest in\nPharma & Healthcare Sector\nBanking & Finance Sector:\nFMCG (fast moving consumer goods) and related sectors.\nTechnology and related sectors\nThematic funds\nThematic funds select stocks of companies in industries that belong to a particular theme - For example, Infrastructure, Service industries, PSUs or MNCs.\nThey are more diversified than Sectoral Funds and hence have lower risk than Sectoral funds.\nValue Funds (Strategy and Style Based Funds)\nEquity funds may be categorized based on the valuation parameters adopted in stock selection, such as\n– Growth funds identify momentum stocks that are expected to perform better than the market\n– Value funds identify stocks that are currently undervalued but are expected to perform well over time as the value is unlocked\nEquity funds may hold a concentrated portfolio to benefit from stock selection.\n– These funds will have a higher risk since the effect of a wrong selection can be substantial on the portfolio’s return\nContra Funds\nContra funds are equity mutual funds that take a contrarian view on the market.\nUnderperforming stocks and sectors are picked at low price points with a view that they will perform in the long run.\nThe portfolios of contra funds have defensive and beaten down stocks that have given negative returns during bear markets.\nThese funds carry the risk of getting calls wrong as catching a trend before the herd is not possible in every market cycle and these funds typically underperform in a bull market.\nAs per the SEBI guidelines on Scheme categorisation of mutual funds, a fund house can either offer a Contra Fund or a Value Fund, not both.\nEquity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS)\nELSS invests at least 80% in stocks in accordance with Equity Linked Saving Scheme, 2005, notified by Ministry of Finance.\nHas lock-in period of 3 years (which is shortest amongst all other tax saving options)\nCurrently eligible for deduction under Sec 80C of the Income Tax Act upto ₹1,50,000\nDEBT SCHEMES\nA debt fund (also known as income fund) is a fund that invests primarily in bonds or other debt securities.\nDebt funds invest in short and long-term securities issued by government, public financial institutions, companies\n– Treasury bills, Government Securities, Debentures, Commercial paper, Certificates of Deposit and others\nDebt funds can be categorized based on the tenor of the securities held in the portfolio and/or on the basis of the issuers of the securities or their fund management strategies, such as\n– Short-term funds, Medium-term funds, Long-term funds\n– Gilt fund, Treasury fund, Corporate bond fund, Infrastructure debt fund\nFloating rate funds, Dynamic Bond funds, Fixed Maturity Plans\nDebt funds have potential for income generation and capital preservation.\nDebt Fund Categories as per SEBI guidelines on Categorization and Rationalization of schemes\nDynamic Bond funds alter the tenor of the securities in the portfolio in line with expectation on interest rates. The tenor is increased if interest rates are expected to go down and vice versa\nFloating rate funds invest in bonds whose interest are reset periodically so that the fund earns coupon income that is in line with current rates in the market, and eliminates interest rate risk to a large extent\nShort-Term Debt Funds\nThe primary focus of short-term debt funds is coupon income. Short term debt funds have to also be evaluated for the credit risk they may take to earn higher coupon income. The tenor of the securities will define the return and risk of the fund.\n– Funds holding securities with lower tenors have lower risk and lower return.\nLiquid funds invest in securities with not more than 91 days to maturity.\nUltra Short-Term Debt Funds hold a portfolio with a slightly higher tenor to earn higher coupon income.\nShort-Term Fund combine coupon income earned from a pre-dominantly short-term debt portfolio with some exposure to longer term securities to benefit from appreciation in price.\nFixed Maturity Plans (FMPs)\n-FMPs are closed-ended funds which eliminate interest rate risk and lock-in a yield by investing only in securities whose maturity matches the maturity of the fund.\n– FMPs create an investment portfolio whose maturity profile match that of the FMP tenor.\n– Potential to provide better returns than liquid funds and Ultra Short Term Funds since investments are locked in\n– Low mark to market risk as investments are liquidated at maturity.\n– Investors commit money for a fixed period.\n– Investors cannot prematurely redeem the units from the fund\n– FMPs, being closed-end schemes are mandatorily listed - investors can buy or sell units of FMPs only on the stock exchange after the NFO.\n– Only Units held in dematerialized mode can be traded; therefore investors seeking liquidity in such schemes need to have a demat accoun\nCapital Protection Oriented Funds\nCapital Protection Oriented Funds are close-ended hybrid funds that create a portfolio of debt instruments and equity derivatives\n– The portfolio is structured to provide capital protection and is rated by a credit rating agency on its ability to do so. The rating is reviewed every quarter.\n– The debt component of the portfolio has to be invested in instruments with the highest investment grade rating.\n– A portion of the amount brought in by the investors is invested in debt instruments that is expected to mature to the par value of the capital invested by investors into the fund. The capital is thus protected.\n– The remaining portion of the funds is used to invest in equity derivatives to generate higher returns\nHybrid funds\nHybrid funds Invest in a mix of equities and debt securities.\nSEBI has classified Hybrid funds into 7 sub-categories as follows:\nSolution-oriented & Other funds\nHybrid funds\nInvest in a mix of equities and debt securities. They seek to find a ‘balance’ between growth and income by investing in both equity and debt.\n– The regular income earned from the debt instruments provide greater stability to the returns from such funds.\n– The proportion of equity and debt that will be held in the portfolio is indicated in the Scheme Information Document\n– Equity oriented hybrid funds (Aggressive Hybrid Funds) are ideal for investors looking for growth in their investment with some stability.\n– Debt-oriented hybrid funds (Conservative Hybrid Fund) are suitable for conservative investors looking for a boost in returns with a small exposure to equity.\n– The risk and return of the fund will depend upon the equity exposure taken by the portfolio - Higher the allocation to equity, greater is the risk\nMulti Asset Funds\nA multi-asset fund offers exposure to a broad number of asset classes, often offering a level of diversification typically associated with institutional investing.\nMulti-asset funds may invest in a number of traditional equity and fixed income strategies, index-tracking funds, financial derivatives as well as commodity like gold.\nThis diversity allows portfolio managers to potentially balance risk with reward and deliver steady, long-term returns for investors, particularly in volatile markets.\nArbitrage Funds\n“Arbitrage” is the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset to take advantage of the price differential in the two markets and profit from price difference of the asset on different markets or in different forms.\n– Arbitrage fund buys a stock in the cash market and simultaneously sells it in the Futures market at a higher price to generate returns from the difference in the price of the security in the two markets.\n– The fund takes equal but opposite positions in both the markets, thereby locking in the difference.\n– The positions have to be held until expiry of the derivative cycle and both positions need to be closed at the same price to realize the difference.\n– The cash market price converges with the Futures market price at the end of the contract period. Thus it delivers risk-free profit for the investor/trader.\n– Price movements do not affect initial price differential because the profit in one market is set-off by the loss in the other market.\n– Since mutual funds invest own funds, the difference is fully the return.\nHence, Arbitrage funds are considered to be a good choice for cautious investors who want to benefit from a volatile market without taking on too much risk.\nIndex Funds\nIndex funds create a portfolio that mirrors a market index.\n– The securities included in the portfolio and their weights are the same as that in the index\n– The fund manager does not rebalance the portfolio based on their view of the market or sector\n– Index funds are passively managed, which means that the fund manager makes only minor, periodic adjustments to keep the fund in line with its index. Hence, Index fund offers the same return and risk represented by the index it tracks.\n– The fees that an index fund can charge is capped at 1.5%\nInvestors have the comfort of knowing the stocks that will form part of the portfolio, since the composition of the index is known.\nExchange Traded Funds (ETFs)\nAn ETF is a marketable security that tracks an index, a commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets like an index fund.\nETFs are listed on stock exchanges.\nUnlike regular mutual funds, an ETF trades like a common stock on a stock exchange. The traded price of an ETF changes throughout the day like any other stock, as it is bought and sold on the stock exchange.\nETF Units are compulsorily held in Demat mode\nETFs are passively managed, which means that the fund manager makes only minor, periodic adjustments to keep the fund in line with its index\nBecause an ETF tracks an index without trying to outperform it, it incurs lower administrative costs than actively managed portfolios.\nRather than investing in an ‘active’ fund managed by a fund manager, when one buy units of an ETF one is harnessing the power of the market itself.\nSuitable for investors seeking returns similar to index and liquidity similar to stocks\nFund of Funds (FoF)\nFund of funds are mutual fund schemes that invest in the units of other schemes of the same mutual fund or other mutual funds.\nThe schemes selected for investment will be based on the investment objective of the FoF\nThe FoF have two levels of expenses: that of the scheme whose units the FoF invests in and the expense of the FoF itself. Regulations limit the total expenses that can be charged across both levels as follows:\n– TER in respect of FoF investing liquid schemes, index funds & ETFs has been capped @ 1%\n– TER of FoF investing in equity-oriented schemes has been capped @ 2.25%\n– TER of FoF investing in other schemes than mentioned above has been capped @2%.\nGold Exchange Traded Funds (FoF)\nGold ETFs are ETFs with gold as the underlying asset\n– The scheme will issue units against gold held. Each unit will represent a defined weight in gold, typically one gram.\n– The scheme will hold gold in form of physical gold or gold related instruments approved by SEBI.\n– Schemes can invest up to 20% of net assets in Gold Deposit Scheme of banks\nThe price of ETF units moves in line with the price of gold on metal exchange.\nAfter the NFO, units are issued to intermediaries called authorized participants against gold or funds submitted. They can also redeem the units for the underlying gol\nBenefits of Gold ETFs\nConvenience --> option of holding gold electronically instead of physical gold.\n– Safer option to hold gold since there are no risks of theft or purity.\n– Provides easy liquidity and ease of transaction.\nFor the purpose of capital gains taxation, Gold ETFs are considered as  \"Specified Mutual Funds\" (i.e., non-equity oriented mutual funds).\nNo wealth tax is applicable on Gold ETFs .\nInternational Funds\nInternational funds enable investments in markets outside India, by holding in their portfolio one or more of the following:\n– Equity of companies listed abroad.\n– ADRs and GDRs of Indian companies.\n– Debt of companies listed abroad.\n– ETFs of other countries.\n– Units of passive index funds in other countries.\n– Units of actively managed mutual funds in other countries.\nInternational equity funds may also hold some of their portfolios in Indian equity or debt.\n– They can hold some portion of the portfolio in money market instruments to manage liquidity.\nInternational funds gives the investor additional benefits of\n– Diversification, since global markets may have a low correlation with domestic markets.\n– Investment options that may not be available domestically.\n– Access to companies that are global leaders in their field.\nThere are risks associated with investing in such funds, such as –\n– Political events and macro economic factors that are less familiar and therefore difficult to interpret\n– Movements in foreign exchange rate may affect the return on redemption\n– Countries may change their investment policy towards global investors.\nFor the purpose of taxation, these funds are considered as non-equity oriented mutual fund schemes.\nHide Menu\nWhat's Covered?\nEQUITY SCHEMES\nSector Specific Funds\nThematic funds\nValue Funds (Strategy and Style Based Funds)\nContra Funds\nEquity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS)\nDEBT SCHEMES\nShort-Term Debt Funds\nFixed Maturity Plans (FMPs)\nCapital Protection Oriented Funds\nHybrid funds\nMulti Asset Funds\nArbitrage Funds\nIndex Funds\nExchange Traded Funds (ETFs)\nFund of Funds (FoF)\nGold Exchange Traded Funds (FoF)\nBenefits of Gold ETFs\nInternational Funds\nRelated Topics\nTypes of MF Schemes\nRisks in MF\nAdvantages of Investing in MF\nAssociation of Mutual Funds in India\nKnow About AMFI\nAbout AMFI\nObjectives\nBoard of Directors\nAMFI Executives\nCommittees\nView More\nMedia\nPress Release\nAMFI Publications\nAMFI Mutual Fund Summit\nGallery\nVideos\nOther Links\nSchedule of Investor Awareness Program\nAMC Branches\nLocate a MF Distributor\nSEBI\nUseful Links\nView More\nTERMS OF USE\n|\nPRIVACY NOTICE\n© 2025 AMFI.

These funds primarily invest in equity and equity-related instruments, offering the potential for high returns along with the added advantage of tax deductions.\nELSS has gained popularity due to its dual advantage of tax efficiency and wealth creation over the long term. It is an ideal choice for those who are comfortable with market-linked investments and aim to build wealth while saving on taxes.\nMeaning of ELSS\nAn ELSS is a diversified equity mutual fund where at least 80% of the corpus is invested in equity and equity-related instruments. It has a lock-in period of three years, which is the shortest among all tax-saving investment options under Section 80C. The returns, though not guaranteed, are market-linked and have the potential to outperform traditional savings instruments in the long run.\nHow ELSS Works\nInvestment:\nInvestors can invest a lump sum or opt for a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) to contribute small amounts regularly.\nLock-in Period:\nOnce invested, the amount is locked in for three years.
